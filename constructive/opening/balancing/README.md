Balancing openings
==================
Balancing refers to making a non-pass call to prevent passing out.  For an
opening, this means opener is at the 4th seat.

Since there is no more opponent to preempt, aggressive preempts are pointless.
As a consequence, except 4♠ and 4♥, there are no more openings from 3NT on.

Weak 2s
-------
The weak 2s are still preemptive, which shows **< 12 HCP** and 6+ cards.
However, a balancing weak 2 shows more offensive values than other seats.

<dl>
  <dt>Unfavorable</dt>
  <dd>12+ points</dd>

  <dt>Both vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>11+ points</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>10+ points</dd>

  <dt>Favorable</dt>
  <dd>9+ points</dd>
</dl>

Why not play strong 2s for the balancing seat?  Weak 2s greatly avoid shitty
auctions like 1♥-1NT; 2♥-3♥; pass.

Preemptive 3s
-------------
Opening 3 of a suit shows 7+ cards and requires opening offensive values (13+
points) but no opening defensive values (< 12 HCP).

Signoff 4♥ & 4♠
---------------
These two are the only openings beyond 3NT because major games are so
profitable.  They now stand for [4♥ and 4♠ openings][4M] with 12+ HCP.
