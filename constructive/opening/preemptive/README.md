Preemptive openings
===================
Preemptive bids are bids higher than usual to aggresively reach a contract,
avoiding defending.  A preemptive opening shows **< 12 HCP**, which encourages
reaching a suit contract and discourages reaching a notrump contract or
defending.

Preemptive openings are available to the first three seats only, where there
is still an opponent to block.  The 3rd seat can make the most aggresive
openings because the partner has passed.

Weak 2s
-------
The weak 2s require 6+ cards for the first two seats, or 5+ cards for
the 3rd seat.  If non-vulnerable, the first two seats can also open a weak 2
with AKxxx or AQJxx.  The strength requirements are as follows.

<dl>
  <dt>Vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>9+ points</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>7+ points</dd>

  <dt>Non-vulnerable vs vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>6+ points or any 7+ cards</dd>
</dl>

Preemptive 3s
-------------
Opening 3 of a suit promises 6+ cards with further requirements.

### First 2 seats ###
If there are only 6 cards in the suit, it shall be no weaker than KJ10xxx if
minor or KQ10xxx if major.  The required strength is 2 more points than weak 2.

<dl>
  <dt>Vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>11+ points and 8+ HCP</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>9+ points</dd>

  <dt>Non-vulnerable vs vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>8+ points</dd>
</dl>

### The 3rd seat ###
Quality of a 6-card minor can be as weak as KJxxxx in the 3rd seat, but no
weaker for a major because one sould bid the weak 2 for a rubbish major.  No
more requirements on defensive values because we will never have enough values
for a 3NT.

<dl>
  <dt>Vulnerable vs non-vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>9+ points</dd>

  <dt>Both vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>8+ points</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>7+ points</dd>

  <dt>Non-vulnerable vs vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>6+ points.  6-card rubbish minor is acceptable here.</dd>
</dl>

Preemptive 4♥ & 4♠ {#preemptive-4M}
------------------
Opening 4 of a major promises 7+ cards.  If there are only 7 cards in the suit,
it shall be no weaker than KQxxxxx.

<dl>
  <dt>Vulnerable vs non-vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>14+ points</dd>

  <dt>Both vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>13+ points</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>12+ points</dd>

  <dt>Non-vulnerable vs vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>11+ points</dd>
</dl>

Namyats
-------
Namyats uses 4♣ and 4♦ for strong 4♥ and 4♠ openers respectively.  Besides
criteria from 4-of-a-major openings, there are further requirements for a
Namyats opening.

<dl>
  <dt>Suit quality</dt>
  <dd>KQ10 or stronger if there are only 7 cards</dd>

  <dt>Stength</dt>
  <dd>At most 5 losers</dd>
</dl>
