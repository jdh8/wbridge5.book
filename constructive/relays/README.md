Miscellaneous relays
====================
A **relay** is a conventional asking bid.  The relay bidding system is based on
the idea that one player precisely describes their hand while their parter
locates the final contract.

The relayer, who bids the relay, becomes the **captain**.  The captain provides
little information about their hand and makes the final decision.  Their parter
is the **puppet**, who describes hand when the captain asks.

Usage of 1-level relay opening is [restricted in competitions][wbf], but relays
as responses and rebids are okay.  Stayman and Blackwood are ubiquitous relays
in modern bidding systems.

Only *floating* realys are listed here.  Relays tightly bound to specific
openings are considered conventions belonging to these openings and hence not
*miscellaneous*.  Stayman only appears after strong notrump openings, which is
an obvious example.
