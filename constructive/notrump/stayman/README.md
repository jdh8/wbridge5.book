Stayman
=======
Stayman is the most used relay in bridge.  This convention helps find 4-4 fit
in a major.

The *vanilla* Stayman requires 9+ points to 1NT and 6+ points to 2NT in order
to safely sign off at the next notrump when no major fit is found.  This also
implies an exactly 4-card major and denies a 6-card major.  Transfer with a
6-card major because a fit is already found.

Stayman is unlimited and gives no information about minors.  It is possible
that responder pursues 6NT or bids a 5-card minor in later rounds.

Garbage Stayman
---------------
As the most frequent rebids are simple ♠, ♥, and ♦, responder can psych a
Stayman with a ♠-♥-♦ *3-suiter* with **insufficient strength**.  Such a
legitimized psych is Garbage Stayman.

Criteria for a *3-suiter* are less strict here.  The 5-4-3-1 pattern also
counts as a *3-suiter*, which ironically provides 56% of hands to this
convention.  However, a 5-card major is unacceptable because a transfer scores
more.

An 1NT opening is assumed in the following examples.

<dl>
  <dt>♠Q83 ♥10984 ♦J10743 ♣2</dt>
  <dd>Off-shape Garbage Stayman.</dd>

  <dt>♠QJ52 ♥10975 ♦8632 ♣4</dt>
  <dd>In-shape Garbage Stayman.</dd>

  <dt>♠J532 ♥108764 ♦AJ7 ♣7</dt>
  <dd>Bid ♦ to transfer to hearts.</dd>
</dl>

Opener's rebids
--------------------
A 5-card major is allowed as an 1NT opener in Wbridge5.  Hence, there are
5-card major rebids after 1NT-2♣.

<dl>
  <dt>2♦</dt>
  <dd>No biddable major.</dd>

  <dt>2♥</dt>
  <dd>Exactly 4 cards in hearts without biddable spades</dd>

  <dt>2♠</dt>
  <dd>Exactly 4 cards in spades without biddable hearts.</dd>

  <dt>2NT(!)</dt>
  <dd>Exactly 4-4 in majors.</dd>

  <dt>3♣!</dt>
  <dd>Minimum with 5 cards in hearts.</dd>

  <dt>3♦!</dt>
  <dd>Minimum with 5 cards in spades.</dd>

  <dt>3♥!</dt>
  <dd>Maximum with 5 cards in hearts.</dd>

  <dt>3♠!</dt>
  <dd>Maximum with 5 cards in spades.</dd>
</dl>

The notrump response showing majors is French standard but unexpected outside.
Therefore, it requires an alert in most countries.

There is no 5-card major in a 2NT opener.  The rebids after 2NT-3♣ are just one
level up from 1NT-2♣.

Second responses to an 1NT opener
---------------------------------
### 1NT-2♣; 2♦ ###
Opener denies a 4-card major.  As a consequence, the only possible major fits
are 3-5, so a second response should show 5 cards.  A 5-card major implies 4
cards in the other major as Stayman requires an exactly 4-card major.

  <dt>3♣, 3♦</dt>
  <dd>Forcing to game, 5+ cards.</dd>
</dl>

### 1NT-2♣; 2♥ ###
Opener's major rebid denies the other major as in the French system.  Responder
immediately knows if there is any major fit.  Opener can infer exactly 4 cards
in the other major from a **misfit** second response.

#### 2♠ as a fitted slam try puppet ####
The 2♠ response is unallocated in Wbridge5.  I think 2♠ should be used for slam
try and giving up quantitative invitation is a bad idea.  Therefore, I made
some **modification** to this system.

The 2♠ response is now a puppet because there is no need to find a fit in spades.
After opener puppets to 2NT, responder would bid a control or RKCB.

<dl>
  <dt>2♠!</dt>
  <dd>Slam try, puppet to 2NT, 16+ points, 4+ support.</dt>

#### 3♥ as a fitted slam try puppet ####
Again, why abandon quantitative invitations?  I would artificialize 3♥ to a
puppet, freeing 4NT.  There is no need to find a fit in hearts, so we can
treat 3♥ like a cuebid.  After opener puppets to 3♠, responder would bid a
control or RKCB.

</dl>

### 1NT-2♣; 2NT(!) ###
Opener's notrump rebid shows both majors.  As a major fit is found, there is no
need to find a minor fit.  Minor bids are South African transfers to clarify
strength.

For Garbage Stayman, the Wbridge5 program generates questionable 1NT-2♣; 2NT-3M
auctions.  Therefore, the responding structure is **modified in this book**.

The transfers are now **strong or weak**.  Garbage Stayman is moved to minors,
prepared to pass as transfer completed.  Keeping bidding after transfer shows
game-forcing strength.  This makes the natural bids exclusively invitational.
Opener no longer bids an incorrect game when responder has garbage.

control bidding.

Second responses to an 2NT opener
---------------------------------
The 2NT opener has significantly more points, and a *vanilla* Stayman requires
game-forcing strength now.  There are some adjustments to reflect this change.

### 2NT-3♣; 3♦ ###
<dl>
  <dt>Pass</dt>
  <dd>Garbage Stayman.</dd>

  <dt>Notrump</dt>
  <dd>Showing strength as no Stayman.</dd>

  <dt>3♠!</dt>
  <dd>Smolen, 5 cards in <strong>hearts</strong>.</dd>

  <dt>4♣, 4♦</dt>
  <dd>Slam try, 5+ cards.</dd>
</dl>

### 2NT-3♣; 3♠/♥ ###
Structure is unchanged from 1NT-2♣; 2♠/♥.

### 2NT-3♣; 3NT(!) ###
There is no invitation here, so direct 4 of majors become signoffs
including Garbage Stayman.  As a logical consequence, the South African
transfers become slam tries.  Nevertheless, they are not puppets because opener
can bid a control instead of completing transfer, e.g. 2NT-3♣; 3NT-4♣; 4♦ shows
a control in diamonds.
