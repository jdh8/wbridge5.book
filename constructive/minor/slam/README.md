Slam bidding
============
In this section, responder is assumed to have strength sufficient for a
strong jump shift.  However, a SJS is not always the best move.  The 1♣-1♦ and
1♦-2♣ responses and Splinter come to help when SJS ill describes the hand.

Slams are games after all, so the seeking process is definitely major > notrump
\> minor.  Always bid a SJS when a 4-card major is present although the SJS
itself can be a minor.

After 1♣
-------------------------
Slam bidding becomes tricky when there is no side suit to jump.  Moreover,
4-card support is not a fit.  Therefore, there must be some continuations to
show **notrump** to handle 3=3=3=4 at least.  **Notrump continuations** exist
anyway then, they take precedence over a *pure* 2♦ for 3-2=4=4 because notrump
games are considered before minor games.

### Precedence of bids ###
1. SJS if 4+ cards in any major
2. Quantitative invitation
3. SJS 2♦
4. Downgrade to a direct Splinter if any void or singleton
5. Catchall 1♦

We would rather bid a downgraded Splinter because only GF 3♣ would be available
if opener rebids 1♥ or 1♠ after our catchall 1♦.

### Quantitative invitation to 6NT ###
With 17~18 HCP and 2~3♠ 2~3♥ 2~4♦ 4+♣, invite to 6NT quantitatively.  Bid 1♦
first because direct 4NT is reserved for RKCB.  If the auction is interfered,
cuebid or redouble to show a generic slam try.  The following show reactions
to opener's rebids in a constructive auction.

<dl>
  <dt>Opener rebids 1♥ or 1♠</dt>
  <dd><strong>Bid 4NT</strong>.  Opener shall recognize this special auction as <strong>quantitative invitation</strong>.</dd>

  <dt>Opener rebids 1NT</dt>
  <dd>Ask strength with Roudy.</dd>

  <dt>Opener rebids 2♣ or 2♦</dt>
  <dd>Opener has distribution, better to seek a minor slam instead.</dd>

  <dt>Opener rebids 2♥ or above</dt>
  <dd>Seek a grand slam, e.g. bid 5NT to invite to both 7NT and 7♣.</dd>
