Slam bidding
============
In this section, responder is assumed to have strength sufficient for a strong
jump shift.  However, a strong jump shift is not always the best move.  The
1♣-1♦ and 1♦-2♣ responses and Splinter come to help when strong jump shifts ill
describe the hand.

After 1♣
--------
Slams are games after all, so the seeking process is definitely major > notrump
\> minor.

### Quantitative invitation to 6NT ###
With 17~18 HCP and 2~3♠ 2~3♥ 2~4♦ 4+♣, invite to 6NT quantitatively.  Bid 1♦
first because direct 4NT is reserved for RKCB.  If the auction is interfered,
cuebid or redouble to show a generic slam try.  The following show reactions
to opener's rebids in a constructive auction.

<dl>
  <dt>Opener rebids 1♥ or 1♠</dt>
  <dd><strong>Bid 4NT</strong>.  Opener shall recognize this special auction as <strong>quantitative invitation</strong>.</dd>

  <dt>Opener rebids 1NT</dt>
  <dd>Ask strength with Roudy.</dd>

  <dt>Opener rebids 2♣ or 2♦</dt>
  <dd>Opener has distribution, better to seek a minor slam instead.</dd>

  <dt>Opener rebids 2♥ or above</dt>
  <dd>Seek a grand slam, e.g. bid 5NT to invite to both 7NT and 7♣.</dd>
