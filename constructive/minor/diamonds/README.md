1♦ response
===========
The 1♦ response usually shows 4+ cards and 6+ points.  Such 1♣-1♦ is the most
constructive auction.  Because it is too constructive and shows no major,
modern bridge players make many reasonable adjustments to the 1♦ response.

Wbridge5 is no exception.  We adjust 1♦ according to responder's strength.

<dl>
  <dt>6~11 points</dt>
  <dd>With a biddable major, <strong>skip diamonds</strong> unless 6+ cards or at least AJxxx or KQJxx.</dd>

  <dt>17+ points</dt>
  <dd>Bid strategic 1♦ with some hands indescribable by strong jump shifts.</dd>

Opener's rebids
---------------
<dl>
  <dt>1♥, 1♠</dt>
  <dd>13~18 points, 4+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>1NT</dt>
  <dd>12~14 HCP, balanced or 5-4-2-2, no biddable major.</dd>

  <dt>2♣</dt>
  <dd>13~18 points, 5+ cards, unbalanced.</dd>

  <dt>2♦</dt>
  <dd>4+ cards, some singleton or void.</dd>

  <dt>2♥, 2♠</dt>
  <dd>19~21 points, 4+ cards, unbalanced or 5-4-2-2.</dd>

  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>18~19 HCP, balanced or 2=2=4=5.</dd>

  <dt>3♣</dt>
  <dd>19~21 points, 6+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>3NT!</dt>
  <dd>18~19 HCP, 6-3-2-2.</dd>
</dl>

A hand with 20 HCP and 6-3-2-2 is strong enough to open 2♣.  Therefore, the 3NT
still shows 18~19 HCP.
