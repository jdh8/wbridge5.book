1♦ response
===========
The 1♦ response usually shows 4+ cards and 6+ points.  Such 1♣-1♦ is the most
constructive auction.  Because it is too constructive and shows no major,
modern bridge players make many reasonable adjustments to the 1♦ response.

Wbridge5 is no exception.  We adjust 1♦ according to responder's strength.

<dl>
  <dt>6~11 points</dt>
  <dd>With a biddable major, <strong>skip diamonds</strong> unless 6+ cards or at least AJxxx or KQJxx.</dd>

  <dt>16+ points</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♦ with 3 diamonds if Splinter and strong jump shifts fail to describe your hand.</dd>
</dl>
