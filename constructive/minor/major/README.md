1♠ and 1♥ responses
===================
The 1♠ and 1♥ responses always shows 4+ cards, usually 6~16 points.  If the
opened suit is void, these responses can be made with insufficient strength.

These responses are a major tool to find a major fit in a 5-card major system.
They take care of situations where opener has no more cards than responder in a
major.  Although opener might still have a 5-card major which is blocked by a
longer minor, these patterns are rare and hence temporarily neglected by
responder.

Opener's rebids
---------------
The 2NT rebid is highly descriptive, so opener shall always consider this rebid
first even if a major fit is found.

<dl>
  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>18~19 HCP, balanced or 2=2=5-4, possible major fit.</dd>
</dl>

Thereafter, opener shall be eager to show a major fit.  Failure to show a major
fit denies 4-card support.

### Found major fit ###
These rebids shows 4+ cards in the responded major.  The partner will
not play in another suit (but a notrump game is still possible).

<dl>
  <dt>Simple raise (2-level)</dt>
  <dd>13~16 points.</dd>

  <dt>Jump raise (3-level)</dt>
  <dd>Invitational, 17~19 points.</dd>

  <dt>Double jump to own suit (4-level)</dt>
  <dd>Fit-showing, 20+ points, 6+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>Double jump to new suit</dt>
  <dd>Splinter, 20+ points, 0~1 card.</dd>

  <dt>Double jump raise (4-level)</dt>
  <dd>18~19 HCP, 5-4-2-2.</dd>
</dl>

### Major fit not found ###
By not bidding 2NT nor showing a major fit, opener denies a major fit.  Opener
has at most 3 cards in the responded major.

<dl>
  <dt>Minimum</dt>
  <dd>Never bid over 2 of own suit.</dd>

  <dt>Medium</dt>
  <dd>Simply bid a new suit.</dd>

  <dt>Maximum</dt>
  <dd>Bid over 2 of own suit.</dd>
