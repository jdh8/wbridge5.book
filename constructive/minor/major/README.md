1♠ and 1♥ responses
===================
The 1♠ and 1♥ responses always shows 4+ cards, usually 6~16 points.  If the
opened suit is void, these responses can be made with insufficient strength.

These responses are a major tool to find a major fit in a 5-card major system.
They take care of situations where opener has no more cards than responder in a
major.  Although opener might still have a 5-card major which is blocked by a
longer minor, these patterns are rare and hence temporarily neglected by
responder.
