Semiforcing 1NT
===============
The 1NT response to a major opening is semiforcing.  The semiforcing 1NT is a
dustbin for hands with 6~11 HCP and no other available bid.  However, with
a flat hand, 3-card support, and exactly 6 or 11 HCP, it is better to bid 1NT
instead of direct support.

In Wbridge5, the 1NT is *more* forcing than an American semiforcing 1NT.

* Opener always rebids 2♣ with 3 cards if balanced.
* A 4-card lower-ranking side suit is never passed by suit quality.

Flat raises
-----------
The 4-3-3 side suits make it awkward to play a suit contract.  The original
raise system brings things too far with 6 and 11 HCP flat raises.  One should
back off by bidding 1NT to guide opener better.

Such 1NT is a bet on opener's usual rebidding.  Opener's rebid provides good
continuations like forcing 1NT.  Opener's pass leads to a mediocre but
acceptable result.  Wbridge5 requires opener with 3 clubs to bid to dissuade
opener from passing.

### Flat weak raise ###
Try to sign off in 2M.

With flat 6 HCP, simple support may lead to disastrous 1M-2M; 3m-3M.  Since 2M
is usually the best contract and 1NT is no worse than 3M, bid 1NT and hope
opener not pass.

### Flat limit raise ###
Invite minimum opener in the next round.

Our special 2NT enforces major fit and never results in a notrump contract.
Bid 1NT to let opener reconsider notrump contracts.

When does opener pass
---------------------
As usual, opener passes when no bid describes.  However, we try hard to bid,
so there are only few hands left for the pass.

<dl>
  <dt>Minimum balanced hands with doubleton clubs</dt>
  <dd>The other 2/3 balanced hands are safely biddable.</dd>

  <dt>Flannery opening hands with no biddable minor</dt>
  <dd>These 4=5=2=2 and 4=5=3=1 hands are inherently hard to bid.</dd>
</dl>

Opener's rebids
---------------
### Choice of strain ###
1. Rebid original suit with 7+ cards.
2. Bid a side suit with 4+ cards and sufficient strength.
3. Rebid original suit with 6 cards.
4. Bid notrump if stronger than 1NT.
5. **Bid the 3-card clubs.**
6. Pass

### Choice of level ###
Unlike minor openers, there is no jump reverse here for the possibility to stop
at 2 of a major.

Second responses to an 1♠ opener
--------------------------------
These 1♠ continuations are mentioned first to derive 1♥ counterparts because
this way is easier than vice versa.  Both bids in 1♠-1NT contain more shapes
than in 1♥-1NT.  Derivation of 1♥ rules from 1♠ ones is simple generalization
except opener's reverse.

Comparison to other 1NT treatments
----------------------------------
I think that Wbridge5's 1NT is an eligible **semi**forcing 1NT because 2♣ rebid
is more frequent than pass.  Naming of American *semi*forcing 1NT is
questionable because pass is still the most frequent call.  Such 1NT should be
called **non**forcing instead.
