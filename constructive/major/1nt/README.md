Semiforcing 1NT
===============
The 1NT response to a major opening is semiforcing.  In Wbridge5, the 1NT is
*more* forcing than an American semiforcing 1NT.

* Opener always rebids 2â™£ with 3 cards if balanced.
* A 4-card lower-ranking side suit is never passed by suit
quality.

When does opener pass
---------------------
As usual, opener passes when no bid describes.  However, we try hard to bid,
so there are only few hands left for the pass.

<dl>
  <dt>Minimum balanced hands with doubleton clubs</dt>
  <dd>The other 2/3 balanced hands are safely biddable.</dd>

  <dt>Flannery opening hands with no biddable minor</dt>
  <dd>These 4=5=2=2 and 4=5=3=1 hands are inherently hard to bid.</dd>
</dl>
