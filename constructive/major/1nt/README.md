Semiforcing 1NT
===============
The 1NT response to a major opening is semiforcing.  In Wbridge5, the 1NT is
*more* forcing than an American semiforcing 1NT.

* Opener always rebids 2♣ with 3 cards if balanced.
* A 4-card lower-ranking side suit is never passed by suit quality.

When does opener pass
---------------------
As usual, opener passes when no bid describes.  However, we try hard to bid,
so there are only few hands left for the pass.

<dl>
  <dt>Minimum balanced hands with doubleton clubs</dt>
  <dd>The other 2/3 balanced hands are safely biddable.</dd>

  <dt>Flannery opening hands with no biddable minor</dt>
  <dd>These 4=5=2=2 and 4=5=3=1 hands are inherently hard to bid.</dd>
</dl>

Opener's rebids
---------------
### After 1♠-1NT ###
Keep in mind that 2♣ is the most frequent call and hence conveys least
information.  Most of the time, responder signs off in 2♠.  Responder must have
a real club suit i.e. 4+ cards to pass 2♣.

Other rebids contain no surprise.

Comparison to American semiforcing 1NT
--------------------------------------
I think that Wbridge5's 1NT is an eligible **semi**forcing 1NT because 2♣ rebid
is more frequent than pass.  American *semi*forcing 1NT is questionable because
pass is still the most frequent call.  Such 1NT should be called nonforcing
instead.
