Constructive 1NT
----------------
The 1NT response is constructive in 1♣-1NT or after an overcall.  Such 1NT
requires 7<sup>+</sup>~10 HCP, balanced distribution, and a stopper in the
adverse suit if the overcall shows one suit.  This response still denies a
biddable major suit because major contracts are often better.

The 1NT under these circumstances are constructive because there are more
suitable calls for 6~7 HCP hands.  For an 1♣ opening, responder can always bid a
suit with these weak hands.  After an overcall, responder can pass because this
pass will not cause a passing out.

Dustbin 1NT
-----------
The 1NT response in 1♠/*♡*/*♢* (pass) 1NT is dustbin, which shows a
constructive 1NT or 6~10 points without another suitable call.

In a constructive auction, a pass to 1 of a suit can only be made from a hand
with < 6 points to prevent a loss of game.  However, bidding on the 2 level
shows at least invitational values.  Therefore, when responder holds a suit
lower than the opening, they has to bid 1NT with a minimum responding hand.

Garbage Stayman
---------------
A legitimized psychic Stayman with a weak 3~4♠ 3~4*♡* 4~5*♢* 0~1♣.  Responder
passes opener's most frequent rebids *viz* 2*♢*, 2*♡*, 2♠.
