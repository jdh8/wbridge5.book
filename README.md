Wbridge5
========
[Wbridge5][wbr5] is a prominent bridge program.  Wbridge5 has been [world
champion of the bridge programs][allevy] in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2015, and 2016.
Besides excellent playing, this program also employs a dedicated bidding
system.  I dream of human pairs using a bidding system like Wbridge5, so I
collate the bidding system in this book.  I have also done a [collation][bss]
in [*Full Disclosure*][fd] format.
