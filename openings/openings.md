Openings
========
A hand with 13+ DH or 12 H is sufficient for an opening.  If both hands in a
pair are opening hands, they can probably make a game contract.  Therefore,
with an opening hand, one must open to prevent a pass out.

Moreover, some hands with good distribution but poor values are suitable for
an opening as well.  These openings are preemptive, which focus on disturbing
opponents from bidding a good contract.

One-of-a-suit openings
----------------------
One must bid 1 of a suit with an opening hand uneligible for a strong opening.
Opening in a major requires 5+ cards, 1*♦* for 4+ cards, 1*♣* for 3+ cards.
With the special shape 4-4-3-2, one opens 1*♦* as a fallback.  If opener finds
more than one eligible suit, bid the longest suit.  If more than one eligible
suit is equally long, bid the highest suit.

Do not consider suit quality.  In bridge, **quantity** is more important than
quality.
