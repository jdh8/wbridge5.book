Openings
========
A hand with 13+ DH or 12 H is sufficient for an opening.  If both hands in a
pair are opening hands, they can probably make a game contract.  Therefore,
with an opening hand, one must open to prevent a pass out.

Moreover, some hands with good distribution but poor values are suitable for
an opening as well.  These openings are preemptive, which focus on disturbing
opponents from bidding a good contract.

One-of-a-suit openings
----------------------
One must bid 1 of a suit with an opening hand uneligible for a strong opening.
Opening in a major requires 5+ cards, 1♦ for 4+ cards, 1♣ for 3+ cards.  With
the special shape 4-4-3-2, one opens 1♦ as a fallback.  If opener finds more
than one eligible suit, bid the longest suit.  If more than one eligible suit
is equally long, bid the highest suit.

Do not consider suit quality.  In bridge, **quantity** is more important than
quality.

<dl>
   <dt>♠10 ♥1054 ♦KJ52 ♣AKJ97</dt>
   <dd>Open 1♣ because clubs is the longer eligible suit.</dd>

   <dt>♠J9864 ♥A8654 ♦A ♣KJ</dt>
   <dd>Open 1♠ because spades is the higher eligible suit.</dd>

   <dt>♠AQ73 ♥Q1087 ♦A862 ♣K</dt>
   <dd>Open 1♦ because diamonds is the only eligible suit.</dd>

   <dt>♠AK74 ♥AJ54 ♦J107 ♣72</dt>
   <dd>Open 1♦ because no suit is eligible.</dd>
</dl>

Strong notrump openings
-----------------------
The strong notrumps alleviate burden of suit openings.  Balanced and
semibalanced hands with specific strength should be opened in notrump.

<dl>
  <dt>1NT</dt>
  <dd>15--17 H, 2--5 cards in each major, 2--6 cards in each minor.</dd>

  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>20--21 H, 2--4 cards in each major, 2--5 cards in each minor.</dd>
</dl>

With 12--14 or 18--19 H, one should always open 1 of a suit.  A simple notrump
rebid stands for weak notrump; a jump notrump rebid shows a hand between 1NT
and 2NT openings.

Strong 2♣ & 2♦ openings
-----------------------
The strong 2♣ shows two kinds of **invitational** hands.  The 2♣ is a limit
bid, so the responder becomes the *captain*.

* 21--23 DH or 4-loser hands unsuitable for a 2NT opening.
* 22--23 H, 2--4 cards in each major, 2--5 cards in each minor.

The strong 2♦ shows a **game-forcing** hand, stronger than 2♣.
