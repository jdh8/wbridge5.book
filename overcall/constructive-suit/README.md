Constructive suits
==================
Constructive suit openings show at least average strength and length in the
bid suit.  One-of-a-suit openings are constructive in a natural bidding system.
Constructive minor openings may move to the 2-level in a strong club or diamond
system.

Simple overcalls
----------------
Simple overcalls are constructive but somewhat limited.  They show 5+ cards in
the bid suit.  Their strength depends on their level.

<dl>
  <dt>1♦</dt>
  <dd>10+ points</dd>

  <dt>1♥, 1♠</dt>
  <dd>8+ points</dd>

  <dt>2♣, 2♦, 2♥, 2♠</dt>
  <dd>11+ points</dd>
</dl>

Hands with 16+ **HCP** are too strong for simple overcalls.  Double first and
then bid the suit in the next round.

In our bidding system, (1♣) 2♣ is natural instead of a Michaels cue bid.
However, clubs was indeed an adverse suit, so a stronger hand is required to
make such a turning bid.

<dl>
  <dt>(1♣) 2♣!</dt>
  <dd>Opening values with 6+ cards</dd>
</dl>

Precise Michaels
----------------
**Precise Michaels** provide surprising auctions for those who have played no
French system.  However, these conventions are quite familiar in France.

Precise Michaels is a combination of Michaels cue bids and unusual notrumps and
a modification from Ghestem.  They show two overcallable suits.

To precisely show all 3 combinations of 2-suiters, 3 bids are needed.
Therefore, one of the 3 of minors would be made a Michaels and no longer a weak
jump overcall.

Moreover, because (1♣) may be short and 2♦ is not so preemptive, the French
also eliminate weak 2♦ overcall.  The major-showing Michaels against clubs
is moved to 2♦, leaving 2♣ a natural simple overcall.

Although unlimited, Michaels cubids are somewhat competitive.  Therefore, their
strength depends on seat and vulnerability, which is described in a [separate
article][michaels] in details.  Nevertheless, 2♦ for majors always requires
mere 8 points because of score and accessibility of a major contract.

Natural 1NT overcall
--------------------
A natural 1NT overcall is almost the same as an 1NT opening.  This bid requires

* 15~18 HCP
* Same distibution as 1NT opening
* Stopper in the adverse suit.

Advancer takes this as an 1NT opening.  This treatment is known as **systems
on**.

Takeout double
--------------
The takeout double is one of the earliest conventions in bridge.  It shows one
of the two kinds of hands.

* 12+ points with tolerance in all nonadverse suits
* 16+ HCP, unsuitable for a notrump or a Michaels

Because this call usually implies shortness in the adverse suit, advancer only
passes with length in the adverse suit, converting the double into penalty.
Otherwise, advancer is forced to bid a suit as cheap as possible with a weak
hand.  Since overcaller has tolerance if minimum, they can safely pass,
completing the competition.

Since a notrump and Michaels are far more specific, they take precedence over a
takeout double.  However, a takeout double takes precedence over a simple
overcall because overcall can bid the suit after the double, which makes a more
specific auction.

Weak jump overcalls
-------------------
A jump in a new suit is always a weak jump overcall by default.  This also
applies to high-level jumps such as (1♣) 4♥.

Weak jump overcalls share the same criteria as preemptive openings.  For
example, (1♣) 2♥ shows the same length and strength as a 2♥ opening.

If partner has passed, one shall preempt as aggressive as 3th-seat opening, for
strength is concentrated in a known opponent.

Gambling 3NT overcall
---------------------
To *gamble* when opponents opened, one must have a **stopper** in the adverse
suit.  This overcall still shows a 7+-card minor lead by AKQ with no stopper in
the **other** side suits.

If opponents opened a minor, one bids 3NT always with the other minor, so
advancer corrects to the assumed minor if they have not enough stoppers to
play 3NT.

The 4-level cue bids
--------------------
The 4-level cue bids are blockbuster takeouts, showing 20+ points and 4+ cards
in every nonadverse suit.  What a cunning way to use 4-level cue bids!
