Over 1 of a suit
================
An 1-of-a-suit opening usually shows at least average strength and length in
the suit.  Defense against conventions is not discussed here.

Opponents' auction deprives little bidding space and shows strength.
Therefore, we shall be more preemptive than in our constructive auction.

Simple overcalls
----------------
Simple overcalls are constructive but somewhat limited.  They show 5+ cards in
the bid suit.  Their strength depends on their level.

<dl>
  <dt>1♦</dt>
  <dd>10+ points</dd>

  <dt>1♥, 1♠</dt>
  <dd>8+ points</dd>

  <dt>2♣, 2♦, 2♥</dt>
  <dd>11+ points</dd>
</dl>

Hands with 16+ **HCP** are too strong for simple overcalls.  Double first and
then bid the suit in the next round.

In our bidding system, (1♣) 2♣ is natural instead of a Michaels cuebid.
However, clubs was indeed an adverse suit, so a stronger hand is required to
make such a turning bid.

<dl>
  <dt>(1♣) 2♣!</dt>
  <dd>Opening values with 6+ cards</dd>
</dl>

Precise Michaels
----------------
Precise Michaels aka **Michaëls précisés** are Michaels cuebids which show
both suits.  These bids are shortcuts to show **5+ cards in 2 suits**.

Precise Michaels are unlimited.  Advancer is unlikely to pass out because the
strain is never a held suit.  Precise Michaels take precedence over takeout
doubles because they are precise in distribution.

To avoid bidding an actual suit, Wbridge5 allocates bidding space as follows.

<table class="center">
<thead>
<tr><th></th><th>(1♠)</th><th>(1♥)</th><th>(1♦)</th><th>(1♣)</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><th>Highest</th><td colspan="2">3♣</td><td colspan="2">2♦</td></tr>
<tr><th>Top & bottom</th><td>2♠</td><td>2♥</td><td>3♦</td><td>3♣</td></tr>
<tr><th>Lowest</th><td colspan="4">2NT</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Unusual notrump ###
Unusual notrump shows the lowest 2 unbid suits.  The following notrump
overcalls are unusual.

<dl>
  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>There is no need to express a natural 2NT.  Takeout double takes care of such strong hands.</dd>

  <dt>1NT by a passed hand</dt>
  <dd>One cannot have passed a strong notrump, so this bid is also unusual.</dd>
</dl>

### Opponents opened a minor ###
<dl>
  <dt>2♦(!)</dt>
  <dd>Highest 2 unbid suits, majors, 8+ points</dd>

  <dt>Unusual notrump</dt>
  <dd>Lowest 2 unbid suits, hearts and the other minor</dd>

  <dt>Jump cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Top & bottom, spades and the other minor</dd>
</dl>

Being unexpected, (1♣) 2♦ requires an alert outside of France, but (1♦) 2♦ is
not alertable because this is the expected meaning of a cuebid.

### Opponents opened a major ###
<dl>
  <dt>Cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Top & bottom, clubs and the other major</dd>

  <dt>Unusual notrump</dt>
  <dd>Lowest 2 unbid suits, minors</dd>

  <dt>3♣!</dt>
  <dd>Highest 2 unbid suits, diamonds and the other major</dd>

  <dt>Jump cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Cuebid with 20+ points</dd>

  <dt>4NT</dt>
  <dd>Super unusual notrump which requres 6+ cards in each minor and 5 more points than 2NT</dd>
</dl>

### Strength ###
Most bids above lack description of strength because their strength depends on
seat and vulnerability.

<dl>
  <dt>Vulnerable vs non-vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>13+ points but 11+ if passed</dd>

  <dt>Both vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>12+ points but 11+ if passed</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>11+ points</dd>

  <dt>Non-vulnerable vs vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>10+ points</dd>
</dl>

Natural 1NT overcall
--------------------
A natural 1NT overcall is almost the same as an 1NT opening.  This bid requires

* 15~18 HCP
* Same distibution as 1NT opening
* Stopper in the adverse suit.

Advancer takes this as an 1NT opening.  This treatment is known as **systems
on**.

Takeout double
--------------
The takeout double is one of the earliest conventions in bridge.  It shows one
of the two kinds of hands.

* 12+ points with tolerance in all nonadverse suits
* 16+ HCP, unsuitable for a notrump or a Michaels

Because this call usually implies shortness in the adverse suit, advancer only
passes with length in the adverse suit, converting the double into penalty.
Otherwise, advancer is forced to bid a suit as cheap as possible with a weak
hand.  Since overcaller has tolerance if minimum, they can safely pass,
completing the competition.

Since a notrump and Michaels are far more specific, they take precedence over a
takeout double.  However, a takeout double takes precedence over a simple
overcall because overcall can bid the suit after the double, which makes a more
specific auction.

### Shape of a minimum takeout double ###
The hand must be in shape to double with < 16 HCP.  Distribution points from
the adverse suit is reconsidered as -1, 1, 3, 5 to upgrade 3-suiters and to
downgrade flat hands.

* 0~3 cards in the adverse suit
* 3~4 cards in each nonadverse major
* 2~5 cards in each nonadverse minor

Weak jump overcalls
-------------------
A jump in a new suit is always a weak jump overcall by default.  This also
applies to high-level jumps such as (1♣) 4♥.

Weak jump overcalls share the same criteria as preemptive openings.  For
example, (1♣) 2♥ shows the same length and strength as a 2♥ opening.

If partner has passed, one shall preempt as aggressive as 3th-seat opening, for
strength is concentrated in a known opponent.

Gambling 3NT overcall
---------------------
To *gamble* when opponents opened, one must have a **stopper** in the adverse
suit.  This overcall still shows a 7+-card minor lead by AKQ with no stopper in
the **other** side suits.

If opponents opened a minor, one bids 3NT always with the other minor, so
advancer corrects to the assumed minor if they have not enough stoppers to
play 3NT.

The 4-level cuebids
--------------------
The 4-level cuebids are blockbuster takeouts, showing 20+ points and 4+ cards
in every nonadverse suit.  What a cunning way to use 4-level cuebids!
