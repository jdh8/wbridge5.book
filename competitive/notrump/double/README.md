Cooperative double
==================
The direct double over RHO's overcall over 1NT opening is cooperative.  The other
doubles are penalty.

The cooperative double is a blend between takeout and penalty doubles.  This
cooperative double requires not only 3~4 cards in each unbid suit like a takeout
double but also 2~4 cards in the called suit to secure conversion to penalty
with opener's 3+ cards.  Moreover, because penalty is expected, 4-3-3-3 is
allowed.

This cooperative double shows 8+ points, i.e. invitational+ values.

<dl>
  <dt>As takeout</dt>
  <dd>Opener can jump to game with maximum.</dd>

  <dt>As penalty</dt>
  <dd>We can defend even if opponents have an 8-card fit.</dd>
</dl>

Opener often passes to convert the double to penalty.  However, opener
sometimes runs.  The Wbridge5 program runs if there are 5+ cards in any suit.
I found this strategy too na√Øve, which occasionally produces disasters when
opponents have a 9-card fit.  I suggest the runout strategy below.

<dl>
  <dt>Run with 5-card major or 6-card minor</dt>
  <dd>It is likely better to play our own suit contract.</dd>

  <dt>Try to run with doubleton called suit</dt>
  <dd>Opponents may have a 9-card fit.</dd>

  <dt>3-level runouts require 5+ cards</dt>
  <dd>2NT is often better if there is only 7-card fit.</dd>
</dl>

If opener has no suit to bid, 2NT is also a valid runout.   It is good to sit
with doubleton if opponents are doubled at 3-level and there is nowhere to run.
Opener may also bid 3NT if this is probably optimal, e.g. with unfavorable
vulnerability.
