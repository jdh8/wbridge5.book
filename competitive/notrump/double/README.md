Cooperative double
==================
The direct double over RHO's overcall over 1NT opening is cooperative.  The other
doubles are penalty.

The cooperative double is a blend between takeout and penalty doubles.  This
cooperative double requires not only 3~4 cards in each unbid suit like a takeout
double but also 2~4 cards in the called suit to secure conversion to penalty
with opener's 3+ cards.  Moreover, because penalty is expected, 4-3-3-3 is
allowed.

This cooperative double shows 8+ points, i.e. invitational+ values.
