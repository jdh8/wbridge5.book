After 1NT
=========
The 2NT is supposed to be too strong to overcall, so this is the only entry for
competitive auctions beginning with strong notrump openings.

In a world of emerging defenses of 1NT, it is urgent to devise a set of
counteractions.  Luckily, Wbridge5 has come up with a good solution.

Responses over an overcall
--------------------------
Although strategies may vary according to the overcall, there are 2 principles
across all overcalls.

<dl>
  <dt>System off</dt>
  <dd>There is no more Stayman nor transfers.</dd>

  <dt>Catchall structure</dt>
  <dd>Artificiality may introduce conventions but seldom changes bidding strcture.</dd>
</dl>

### Over double ###
We have no conventional runout because 1NTx is often good enough.  Opponents
are worried about the double, too.  Opener only runs to a suit with 5+ cards.

<dl>
  <dt>XX</dt>
  <dd>Invitational+.</dd>

  <dt>2♣, 2♦, 2♥, 2♠</dt>
  <dd>Signoff, 5+ cards, too weak to invite.</dd>

  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>Unusual, 5+ cards in each minor, too weak to invite.</dd>
</dl>

### Over 2 of a suit ###
<dl>
  <dt>X</dt>
  <dd>Optional double, invitational+, 2~4 cards in the overcalled suit, 3~4 cards in the other suits.</dd>

  <dt>2 of a new suit</dt>
  <dd>Signoff, 5+ cards, too weak to invite.</dd>

  <dt>2NT!</dt>
  <dd>Lebensohl, invitational strength, puppet to 3♣.</dd>

  <dt>3 of a new suit</dt>
  <dd>Forcing to game, 5+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>3NT</dt>
  <dd>Signoff</dd>
</dl>
