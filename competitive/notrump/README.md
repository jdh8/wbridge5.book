Opened 1NT
==========
The 2NT is supposed to be too strong to overcall, so this is the only entry for
competitive auctions beginning with strong notrump openings.

In a world of emerging defenses of 1NT, it is urgent to devise a set of
counteractions.  Luckily, Wbridge5 has come up with a good solution.

Although strategies may vary according to the overcall, there are 2 principles
across all overcalls.

<dl>
  <dt>System off</dt>
  <dd>There is no more Stayman nor transfers.</dd>

  <dt>Catchall structure</dt>
  <dd>Artificiality may introduce conventions but seldom changes bidding strcture.</dd>
</dl>

Responses over (Dbl)
--------------------
We have no conventional runout because 1NTx is often good enough.  Opponents
are worried about the double, too.  Opener only runs to a suit with 5+ cards.

<dl>
  <dt>XX</dt>
  <dd>Invitational+.</dd>

  <dt>2♣, 2♦, 2♥, 2♠</dt>
  <dd>Signoff, 5+ cards, too weak to invite.</dd>

  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>Unusual, 5+ cards in each minor, too weak to invite.</dd>
</dl>

Responses over (2 of a suit)
----------------------------
The cooperative double is not changed for artificial overcalls.  This may be
counterintuitive, but Lebensohl already takes care of the overcalled suit.
It is better to still use the double to find a 4-4 fit.

Lebensohl is the only alertable convention here.  Conventions at 4-level (4♦!,
4♠!) are cancelled because these 2-suiters can be expressed at 3-level first.

<dl>
  <dt>X</dt>
  <dd>Cooperative double, invitational+, 2~4 cards in the overcalled suit, 3~4 cards in the other suits.</dd>

  <dt>2 of a new suit</dt>
  <dd>Signoff, 5+ cards, too weak to invite.</dd>

  <dt>2NT!</dt>
  <dd>Lebensohl, invitational strength, puppet to 3♣.</dd>

  <dt>3 of a new suit</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, 5+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>3NT</dt>
  <dd>Signoff with all adverse suits stopped.</dd>
</dl>

### Cuebids ###
An adverse suit is a suit known to be held by opponents, *aka* an anchor suit.
An overcall introduces 0~2 adverse suits.  For example, Cappelletti 2♣
introduces no adverse suit, natural 2♣ one (♣), Landy 2♣ two (♠, ♥).  A takeout
is deemed suitless as a takeout double.

Cuebidding is to bid an adverse suit.  Cuebids show game-forcing values but
unsuitable to bid 3NT.  Detailed meanings are introduced in the following
subsections.

#### With 1 adverse suit ####
If the overcall is nonforcing, a pass may end the auction.  Therefore, hands
with more game aspect deserve a direct cuebid.  The delayed cuebid denies
stopper in the adverse suit, making it tolerable to pass out.

If the overcall is transfer, there may be 2 available cuebids below 3NT.  The
direct cuebid is mapped at 3-level, the delayed at 2-level, to achieve the same
safety without passing out.

<dl>
  <dt>Direct 3-level cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Takeout with game-forcing values, 4+ cards in every nonadverse suit.</dd>

  <dt>Delayed or 2-level cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, adverse suit unstopped.</dd>
</dl>

#### With 2 adverse suits ####
Because there are 4 possible stopper combinations, 3 cuebid patterns are needed
to seek 3NT.  The 2 direct cuebids shows the only stopped adverse suit.  The
delayed cuebid denies any stopped adverse suit, where passing out is tolerable.

<dl>
  <dt>Cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, stopper, the other adverse suit unstopped.</dd>

  <dt>Pass then cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, both adverse suits unstopped.</dd>
</dl>

Responses over (2NT)
--------------------
The 2NT overcall is a cuebid and notrump contracts are hard to play, so this
call is innately forcing.  The force gives responder a second chance to bid,
which makes up the loss of our Lebensohl 2NT.

The 2NT overcall usually shows both minors, which is not only practical but
also logical.  A convention skipping majors is usually minor-oriented, and
1-suited hands can be shown at 3-level.

The double seems useless.  It dissuades opener from bidding, letting responder
penalize opponents in the next round.

<dl>
  <dt>X</dt>
  <dd>Invitational+, 4-3-3-3 in align with the cooperative double.</dd>

  <dt>New suit</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, 5+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>4♦!</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, 5-5 or 6-6 in majors.</dd>
</dl>

### In the next round ###
Unless vulerability is unfavorable, penalty is often better than 3NT if
responder has strength but no biddable suit.  If we can make 3NT, their 3-level
contract often goes -3 or more.

<dl>
  <dt>X</dt>
  <dd>Penalty</dd>

  <dt>Cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, the bid suit unstopped.</dd>

  <dt>New suit</dt>
  <dd>Invitational, 5+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>3NT</dt>
  <dd>Signoff with all adverse suits stopped.</dd>
</dl>

Responses over (3 of a suit)
----------------------------
The bidding structure is the same as competition on 2-level, but tactics are
slightly changed.  After an cooperative double, opener is reluctant to bid over
3NT.  Therefore, doubling a major suit, especially 3♠, is more penal and off
shape.  Responder usually doubles 3♠/♥ instead of signing off at 3NT.

<dl>
  <dt>X</dt>
  <dd>Cooperative double, invitational+, 3~4 cards in higher suits, 2~4 cards in the other suits.</dd>

  <dt>3 of a new suit</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, 5+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>3NT</dt>
  <dd>Signoff with all adverse suits stopped.</dd>
</dl>
