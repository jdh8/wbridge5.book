After 1NT
=========
The 2NT is supposed to be too strong to overcall, so this is the only entry for
competitive auctions beginning with strong notrump openings.

In a world of emerging defenses of 1NT, it is urgent to devise a set of
counteractions.  Luckily, Wbridge5 has come up with a good solution.

  <dd>There is no more Stayman nor transfers.</dd>

  <dt>Immutable structure</dt>
  <dd>Our bidding structure depends on the overcall itself instead of their actual suit.</dd>
