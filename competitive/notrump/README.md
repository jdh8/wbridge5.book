After 1NT
=========
The 2NT is supposed to be too strong to overcall, so this is the only entry for
competitive auctions beginning with strong notrump openings.

In a world of emerging defenses of 1NT, it is urgent to devise a set of
counteractions.  Luckily, Wbridge5 has come up with a good solution.

Responses over an overcall
--------------------------
Although strategies may vary according to the overcall, there are 2 principles
across all overcalls.

<dl>
  <dt>System off</dt>
  <dd>There is no more Stayman nor transfers.</dd>

  <dt>Catchall structure</dt>
  <dd>Artificiality may introduce conventions but seldom changes bidding strcture.</dd>
</dl>

### Over double ###
We have no conventional runout because 1NTx is often good enough.  Opponents
are worried about the double, too.  Opener only runs to a suit with 5+ cards.

<dl>
  <dt>XX</dt>
  <dd>Invitational+.</dd>

  <dt>2♣, 2♦, 2♥, 2♠</dt>
  <dd>Signoff, 5+ cards, too weak to invite.</dd>

  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>Unusual, 5+ cards in each minor, too weak to invite.</dd>
</dl>

### Over 2 of a suit ###
An adverse suit is a suit known to be held by opponents, *aka* an anchor suit.
An overcall introduces 0~2 adverse suits.  For example, Cappelletti 2♣
introduces no adverse suit, natural 2♣ one (♣), Landy 2♣ two (♠, ♥).  A takeout
is deemed suitless as a takeout double.

The optional double is not changed for artificial overcalls.  This may be
counterintuitive, but Lebensohl already takes care of the overcalled suit.
It is better to still use the double to find a 4-4 fit.

<dl>
  <dt>X</dt>
  <dd>Optional double, invitational+, 2~4 cards in the overcalled suit, 3~4 cards in the other suits.</dd>

  <dt>2 of a new suit</dt>
  <dd>Signoff, 5+ cards, too weak to invite.</dd>

  <dt>2NT!</dt>
  <dd>Lebensohl, invitational strength, puppet to 3♣.</dd>

  <dt>3 of a new suit</dt>
  <dd>Forcing to game, 5+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>3NT</dt>
  <dd>Signoff with all adverse suits stopped.</dd>
</dl>

#### With 1 adverse suit ####
The direct cuebid seeks a major game more than 3NT.  The delayed cuebid seeks
3NT.

<dl>
  <dt>Cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing takeout, 4+ cards in every nonadverse suit.</dd>

  <dt>Pass then cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, adverse suit unstopped.</dd>
</dl>

#### With 2 adverse suits ####
Dedicated takeout is less useful.  Cuebids seek 3NT.

<dl>
  <dt>Cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, stopper, the other adverse suit unstopped.</dd>

  <dt>Pass then cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, both adverse suits unstopped.</dd>
</dl>
