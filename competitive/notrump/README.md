After 1NT
=========
The 2NT is supposed to be too strong to overcall, so this is the only entry for
competitive auctions beginning with strong notrump openings.

In a world of emerging defenses of 1NT, it is urgent to devise a set of
counteractions.  Luckily, Wbridge5 has come up with a good solution.

Responses over an overcall
--------------------------
Although strategies may vary according to the overcall, there are 2 principles
across all overcalls.

<dl>
  <dt>System off</dt>
  <dd>There is no more Stayman nor transfers.</dd>

  <dt>Catchall structure</dt>
  <dd>Artificiality may introduce conventions but seldom changes bidding strcture.</dd>
</dl>

### Over double ###
We have no conventional runout because 1NTx is often good enough.  Opponents
are worried about the double, too.  Opener only runs to a suit with 5+ cards.

<dl>
  <dt>XX</dt>
  <dd>Invitational+.</dd>

  <dt>2♣, 2♦, 2♥, 2♠</dt>
  <dd>Signoff, 5+ cards, too weak to invite.</dd>

  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>Unusual, 5+ cards in each minor, too weak to invite.</dd>
</dl>

### Over 2 of a suit ###
The optional double is not changed for artificial overcalls.  This may be
counterintuitive, but Lebensohl already takes care of the overcalled suit.
It is better to still use the double to find a 4-4 fit.

Lebensohl is the only alertable convention here.  Conventions at 4-level (4♦!,
4♠!) are cancelled because these 2-suiters can be expressed at 3-level first.

<dl>
  <dt>X</dt>
  <dd>Optional double, invitational+, 2~4 cards in the overcalled suit, 3~4 cards in the other suits.</dd>

  <dt>2 of a new suit</dt>
  <dd>Signoff, 5+ cards, too weak to invite.</dd>

  <dt>2NT!</dt>
  <dd>Lebensohl, invitational strength, puppet to 3♣.</dd>

  <dt>3 of a new suit</dt>
  <dd>Forcing to game, 5+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>3NT</dt>
  <dd>Signoff with all adverse suits stopped.</dd>
</dl>

An adverse suit is a suit known to be held by opponents, *aka* an anchor suit.
An overcall introduces 0~2 adverse suits.  For example, Cappelletti 2♣
introduces no adverse suit, natural 2♣ one (♣), Landy 2♣ two (♠, ♥).  A takeout
is deemed suitless as a takeout double.

Cuebids show game-forcing values but unsuitable to bid 3NT.  Detailed meanings
are introduced in the following subsections.

#### Cuebids with 1 adverse suit ####
If the overcall is nonforcing, a pass may end the auction.  Therefore, hands
with more game aspect deserve a direct cuebid.  The delayed cuebid denies
stopper in the adverse suit, making it tolerable to pass out.

If the overcall is transfer, there may be 2 available cuebids below 3NT.  The
direct cuebid is mapped at 3-level, the delayed at 2-level, to achieve the same
safety without passing out.

<dl>
  <dt>Direct 3-level cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing takeout, 4+ cards in every nonadverse suit.</dd>

  <dt>Delayed or 2-level cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, adverse suit unstopped.</dd>
</dl>

#### Cuebids with 2 adverse suits ####
Because there are 4 possible stopper combinations, 3 cuebid patterns are needed
to seek 3NT.  The 2 direct cuebids shows the only stopped adverse suit.  The
delayed cuebid denies any stopped adverse suit, where passing out is tolerable.

<dl>
  <dt>Cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, stopper, the other adverse suit unstopped.</dd>

  <dt>Pass then cuebid</dt>
  <dd>Game-forcing values, both adverse suits unstopped.</dd>
</dl>
