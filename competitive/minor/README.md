After 1 of a minor
==================

Responses after a takeout double
--------------------------------
The takeout double shows opening values, so responder should bid more
preemptively.  There are some adjustments to the basic structure.

Playing 2NT or 3NT is infeasible now as 1♣xx is more profitable.  As a result,
the meaning of 2NT is changed to a convention and 3NT is never used now.  For
their original meanings, redouble instead.

Jump shifts become **weak** if responder unpassed.  Redouble to show strength
for original strong jump shifts.  Keep in mind that **fit-showing** by a passed
responder are unadjusted because *the previous **pass denies both** jump
shifts*.

Responses after a simple suit overcall
--------------------------------------
Wbridge5 employs French convention for such low-level competitive auctions.
The French insist on showing length of hearts quickly to compete with
opponents' latent spades.

### Collante ###
The French word *collante* means “sticky” in English.  This means that a
negative double after a 1♦ or 1♥ overcall shows exactly 4 cards in **the next
suit** *viz* ♥ or ♠ respectively.  As a consequence, the direct bid of the suit
now shows 5+ cards.

Be aware that Collante only affects one suit.  The meaning of 1♠ in 1♣ (1♦) 1♠
is the same as 1♣-1♠, which shows 4+ cards in spades, because only hearts is
affected by (1♦).

<dl>
  <dt>1m (1♦) X</dt>
  <dd>Negative double, 6+ points with exactly 4 hearts.</dd>

  <dt>1m (1♦) 1♥</dt>
  <dd>Free bid, 6+ points with 5+ hearts.</dd>

  <dt>1m (1♦) 1♠</dt>
  <dd>Free bid, 6+ points with 4+ spades.</dd>

  <dt>1m (1♥) X</dt>
  <dd>Negative double, 6+ points with exactly 4 spades.</dd>

  <dt>1m (1♥) 1♠</dt>
  <dd>Free bid, 6+ points with 5+ spades.</dd>
</dl>

### Rodrigue ###
This convention is uncommon in France, but is used by Wbridge5.  After a 1♠
overcall, we give up the simple raise for a negative free bid of hearts.  This
bid differentiates with the negative double by showing 5+ cards of hearts,
making the negative double show exactly 4 cards.

Wbridge5 madly insists on showing length of hearts quickly to compete with
opponents' spades.

<dl>
  <dt>1m (1♠) X</dt>
  <dd>Negative double, 6+ points with exactly 4 hearts.</dd>

  <dt>1m (1♠) 2m!</dt>
  <dd>Negative free bid of <strong>hearts</strong>, 6~10 points with 5+ hearts.</dd>

  <dt>1m (1♠) 2♥</dt>
  <dd>(Positive) free bid, 11+ points with 5+ hearts.</dd>

  <dt>1m (1♠) 3m</dt>
  <dd>Mixed raise, 9+ points with 5+ support.</dd>
