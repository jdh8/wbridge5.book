1♦ and 1♣ openings
==================
The minor openings are the most frequent openings.  Particularly, 1♣ is the
most frequent, 1♦ the second.  Therefore, it is important to learn the
continuation of these openings.

The minor openings can be made from three kinds of hands:

* Open the longer minor in a balanced hand with 12~14 or 18~19 H without a
  5-card major.
* Open the longest suit in an unbalanced hand with normal openings strength.
* Open the longest suit in a 3-suiter or 5-4-3-1 with 2♣ strength where the
  5-card suit is a minor.  See also [the dedicated section][big].

Opener probably has a 4-card major.  Therefore, responder should always think
about bidding the major first.  A **notrump** or a **support in minor** always
**denies** a biddable **major**.

Responses to 1♣
---------------
The 1NT response is always constructive because there is no suit below clubs.
When 1NT acts as a dustbin, responder bids 1NT to show a suit below the
opening.  This is obviously not the case for 1♣.

<dl>
  <dt>1♦, 1♥, 1♠</dt>
  <dd>6~16 points or void clubs, 4+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>1NT</dt>
  <dd>Constructive 1NT, 7<sup>+</sup>~10 HCP, balanced.</dd>

  <dt>2♣</dt>

  <dd>Strong jump shift, 17+ points, 4+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>Invitation to 3NT, 10~11 HCP, balanced.</dd>

  <dt>3♣</dt>
  <dd>Limit raise, invite to 3NT or 5♣, 11~16 points, 5+ support.</dd>

  <dt>3♦!, 3♥!, 3♠!</dt>
  <dd>Splinter, 12~16 points, <strong>0~1 card</strong>, 5+ support.</dd>

  <dt>3NT</dt>
  <dd>To play, 12~15 HCP, balanced.</dd>
</dl>

### Choice of new suit ###
1. Choose the longest suit.
2. To break a tie, bid the cheapest **call** for 4-4, the highest **suit** for
   5-5 or above.
3. Nevertheless, if responder cannot virtually 2/1 (< 12 points) but has normal
   responding strength (5+ HCP) and a biddable major, **skip diamonds** unless
   6+ cards or at least AJxxx or KQJxx.

We can usually make 2 of a suit and sometimes 1NT with normal responding
strength.  Bypassing diamonds slightly preempts in a partscore dog fight.
However, when responding with void clubs and insufficient strength, bid
1♦ to seek 1♠/♥.

<dl>
  <dt>♠K965 ♥65 ♦KJ863 ♣98</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♠.  Skip diamonds because you cannot force to game.</dd>

  <dt>♠10983 ♥9 ♦KQJ103 ♣J72</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♦.  These diamonds are eligible.</dd>

  <dt>♠KQ93 ♥72 ♦AK73 ♣J63</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♦ because you can force to game.</dd>

  <dt>♠KQ105 ♥7643 ♦J642 ♣10</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♥.  Skip diamonds, and then 1♥ is the cheaper call.</dd>

  <dt>♠Q974 ♥A1062 ♦AQ108 ♣7</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♦.  No skipping for a game-forcing hand.</dd>
</dl>

### Simple raise ###
The 2♣ simple raise is not so simple.

For preemption, responder raises to 2♣ with 4+ clubs and no 4-card major in a
non-constructive hand.  This is the only case that 2♣ responder should has only
4 clubs.

For a constructive hand, responder always raises with 5+ clubs and an
unbalanced distribution because constructive 1NT is preferred.

<dl>
  <dt>♠976 ♥965 ♦A109 ♣J1085</dt>
  <dd>Bid 2♣.  This hand is too weak for constructive 1NT.</dd>

  <dt>♠QJ6 ♥J5 ♦J932 ♣J987</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♦.  This hand is too weak for constructive 1NT.</dd>

  <dt>♠964 ♥104 ♦AJ65 ♣A1094</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1NT.  The constructive 1NT is preferred over a minor suit.</dd>

  <dt>♠53 ♥K84 ♦432 ♣KQ765</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1NT.  The constructive 1NT is preferred over a minor suit.</dd>

  <dt>♠8 ♥J43 ♦Q762 ♣A6432</dt>
  <dd>Bid 2♣.  Make a constructive raise with unbalanced distribution.</dd>
</dl>

### Adjusted responses by a passed responder ###
Since responder has made a limit pass, which denies stength of opening,
new-suit responses are no longer forcing.

Jump shifts from 2♥ on are fit-showing because responder gave up preemptive
opening.

  <dt>2♦</dt>
  <dd>Weak jump shift, 8+ points, 6+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>2♥!, 2♠!, 3♦!</dt>
  <dd>Fit-showing, 11+ points, 5+ cards, 5+ support.</dd>
