Slam bidding
============
In this section, responder is assumed to have strength sufficient for a
strong jump shift.  However, a SJS is not always the best move.  The 1♣-1♦ and
1♦-2♣ responses and Splinter come to help when SJS ill describes the hand.

Slams are games after all, so the seeking process is definitely major > notrump
\> minor.  Always bid a SJS when a 4-card major is present although the SJS
itself can be a minor.

Strong jump shifts
------------------
SJS is a frequent slam bidding utility.  SJS in Wbridge5 shows 17+ points and
4+ cards.  There are few other requirements, even fewer than Soloway jump
shifts.  This practically confines 1-over-1 responses to 6~16 points, except
that 1♦ catches strong hands unsuitable for SJS.

### Opener's rebids over major SJS ###
SJS is forcing and opener rebids below the major game.  Most of the time,
responder has 17~19 points, so opener shall be eager to describe distribution
instead of strength.  Opener is the captain unless a notrump is bid.  Notrump
shows strength as well as balancedness because there are 2NT and 3NT to choose
from.

<dl>
  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>Balanced minimum, 11~14 HCP.</dd>

  <dt>Own suit</dt>
  <dd>6+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>Raise or new suit</dt>
  <dd>4+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>3NT</dt>
  <dd>Balanced maximum, 18~21 HCP.</dd>

  <dt>Jump to own suit</dt>
  <dd>Fit-showing, 6+ cards, 4+ support.</dd>

  <dt>Jump to new suit</dt>
  <dd>Splinter, 15+ points, 0~1 card, 4+ support.</dd>
</dl>

Special auctions after 1♣
-------------------------
Slam bidding becomes tricky when there is no side suit to jump.  Moreover,
4-card support is not a fit.  Therefore, there must be some continuations to
show **notrump** to handle 3=3=3=4 at least.  **Notrump continuations** exist
anyway then, they take precedence over a *pure* 2♦ for 3-2=4=4 because notrump
games are considered before minor games.

### Precedence of bids ###
RKCB is unlisted because only unusual hands deserve that 4NT.  RKCB in later
rounds is better most of the time.

1. Any SJS with a 4-card major
2. Quantitative invitation
3. SJS 2♦
4. Splinter
5. Catchall 1♦

It is too risky to delay Splinter after 1♦ because opener is likely to bid a
major.

### SJS 2♦ ###
Because minor games are cheaper and at least 5-level, be weary of them and
manage to find a major game.  The 3♥ and 3♠ rebids are reserved for 5-card
majors skipped in opening due to a longer minor, which is clubs here.  Other
rebids have the same meanings as rebids to major SJS, but a major rebid is
considered first.

Opener still rebids below 4♦ because it wastes too much space to bid a Spliner
from 4♥ on.  The 3♦ rebid catches unbalanced diamond fits with no biddable
major.

### Quantitative invitation to 6NT ###
With 17~18 HCP and 2~3♠ 2~3♥ 2~4♦ 4+♣, invite to 6NT quantitatively.  Fake a
catchall 1♦ first because direct 4NT is reserved for RKCB.  If the auction is
interfered, cuebid or redouble to show a generic slam try.  The following show
reactions to opener's rebids in a constructive auction.

<dl>
  <dt>Opener rebids 1♥ or 1♠</dt>
  <dd><strong>Bid 4NT</strong>.  Opener shall recognize this special auction as <strong>quantitative invitation</strong>.</dd>

  <dt>Opener rebids 1NT</dt>
  <dd>Ask strength with Roudy.</dd>

  <dt>Opener rebids 2♣ or 2♦</dt>
  <dd>Opener has distribution, better to seek a minor slam instead.</dd>

  <dt>Opener rebids 2♥ or above</dt>
  <dd>Seek a grand slam, e.g. bid 5NT to invite to both 7NT and 7♣.</dd>
</dl>

### Quantitative invitation to 7NT ###
Direct 5NT is quantitative invitation to 7NT.  Bidding a grand slam requires
about 2/3 probability, so stricter rules apply.  Quantitatively invite to 7NT
with 20~22 HCP and 3=3=3=4.  Bid a SJS for any side suit.  Bid 1♦ or 4NT for a
club fit.  This 5NT rebid is discouraged because it is too aggressive for a
grand slam.

Opener signs off because responder has precisely described the hand.

Special auctions after 1♦
-------------------------
There are fewer exceptions than 1♣.  There is no need for a notrump strain
because responder can raise with mere 4 diamonds.  The 1♦-2♣; \*-3♦ is a
natural *SJS in diamonds*, the assumed meaning of a delayed raise after 2/1.

The only possible responses of a responder with 17+ points are as follows.

<dl>
  <dt>2♣</dt>
  <dd>2/1, 12+ points, 4+ cards but may be short if 17+ points.</dd>

  <dt>2♥, 2♠</dt>
  <dd>Strong jump shift, 17+ points, 4+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>3♣</dt>
  <dd>Strong jump shift, 18+ points, 6+ clubs or 4+ clubs with 6+ diamonds.</dd>
</dl>

### Precedence of bids ###
1. Bid 3♣ if clubs is longer than each major
2. Choose among 2♠, 2♥, 2♣ as if they were 1♠, 1♥, 2♣ respectively.
3. Bid 2♣ since only diamonds is biddable.
