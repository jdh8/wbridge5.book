Forcing 2/1
===========
The concept that 2/1 auctions should be forcing to game has been popular since
1990s.  The world is gradually moving from *standard* to 2/1.  Wbridge5 is also
a move based on SEF, the French *standard*.  

The 2/1 in Wbridge5 is Lawrence-style.

* The game force may be cancelled if either one rebids own suit.
* Opener's reverses and jumps require extra strength.

The Wbridge5 program overestimates values of unbalanced hands.  It bid 2/1 with
highly unbalanced hands with 9~10 HCP but ended up with no playable game.  I
have devised a better strategy described in later sections.
