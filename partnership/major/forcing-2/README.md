Forcing 2/1
===========
The concept that 2/1 auctions should be forcing to game has been popular since
1990s.  The world is gradually moving from *standard* to 2/1.  Wbridge5 is also
a move based on SEF, the French *standard*.  

The 2/1 in Wbridge5 is Lawrence-style.

* The game force may be cancelled if either one rebids own suit.
* Opener's reverses and jumps require extra strength.

The Wbridge5 program overestimates values of unbalanced hands.  It bid 2/1 with
highly unbalanced hands with 9~10 HCP but ended up with no playable game.  I
have devised a better strategy.

The 2/1 bids has low priority due to its ambiguity.  Raises, 1NT, and
fit-showing conventions are limit bids and show whether a fit is found.  The
2/1 bids, unlimited and ambiguous about fit, can be viewed as natural relays.

The 2/1 responses
-----------------
There are 3 criteria corresponding to the 3 kinds of games *viz.* major,
notrump, and minor.  Any met criterion makes a hand eligible for 2/1.

* Found major fit or 1♠-2♥, 12+ points
* 11+ HCP but no flat 11 HCP
* With long minor, 14+ points (but 13 points is okay for 1♥-2♦)

These criteria are based on visualization of maximum hands to pass the
semiforcing 1NT, i.e. 13~14 HCP and usually 5-3=3=2.  Nevertheless, under this
circumstance, 1♥ opener's best distribution for responder to bid 2♦ is 4=5=3=1,
so 1 fewer point is needed.

### 2♥ vs SJS 3♥ ###
Both of them are unlimited.  There are strict criteria on 3♥ because it
consumes too much space.  With 17+ points and 5+ hearts, bid 2♥ unless there
are 7+ hearts and 0~2 spades.
