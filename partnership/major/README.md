1♠ and 1♥ openings
==================
Modern bidding systems often require 5+ cards to open in a major.  This is
somewhat *conventional* because usually a 4-card suit is biddable in bridge,
but this greatly improves search of 5-3 and 6-2 major fits.

Although minor openings are lower and more frequent, major openings are
explained first because

1. Major openings are more symmetric where both require 5+ cards.
2. There are fewer mediocre exceptional bids which are difficult for beginners.
3. Some conventions designed for majors can also apply to minors.

Light openings
--------------
Opening a major at the last 2 seats requires only 11+ HCP and 5+ cards.

Nevertheless, a weak 2 can be made with only 5 cards at a non-unfavorable 3rd
seat.  This phenomenon excludes Drury from the Wbridge5 bidding system because
major openings at the 3rd seat are seldom light.

### Adjusted responses by a passed responder ###
Responses from a passed responder are no longer forcing because the previous
pass has limited the strength.  Some conventions are cancelled to make these
bids passable.

Preemptive raise to the 4-level
-------------------------------
Such raise directly jumps to game, showing at most 8<sup>&minus;</sup> HCP and
4+ support.  Its minimum strength is determined by vulnerability.

<dl>
  <dt>Unfavorable</dt>
  <dd>10+ points</dd>

  <dt>Both vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>9+ points</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>8+ points</dd>

  <dt>Favorable</dt>
  <dd>7+ points</dd>
</dl>

Major raise structure
---------------------
The **12 points** are intentionally duplicated in this table.  It is difficult
to find clear-cut game-forcing hands with only points.

With a flat hand, 3-card support, and 6 or 11 HCP, bid 1NT for better
continuations.

<table>
<caption>Major raise structure for an unpassed responder</caption>
<thead>
<tr><th></th><th>3-card support</th><th>4+-card support</th></tr>

Choice of new suit
------------------
1. Choose the longest suit.
2. To break a tie, bid the cheapest **call** for 4-4, the highest **suit** for
   5-5 or above.

In the following examples, your partner opened 1♥ and you have not passed.
<dl>
  <dt>♠9872 ♥A ♦65 ♣A76532</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♠.  This hand is too weak to bid 2♣.</dd>

  <dt>♠J52 ♥AK ♦K983 ♣K874</dt>
  <dd>Bid 2♣.  Bid the cheapest call for 4-4.</dd>

  <dt>♠KJ10 ♥- ♦K10876 ♣K8764</dt>
  <dd>Bid 2♦.  Bid the highest suit for 5-5.</dd>

  <dt>♠K10543 ♥2 ♦J6 ♣AKQ62</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♠.  Bid the highest suit for 5-5.</dd>

  <dt>♠AK8 ♥AJ86 ♦A83 ♣A86</dt>
  <dd>Bid 2♣.  This hand is too strong for 3NT.  Feel free to lie about a minor with a blockbuster.</dd>
</dl>

Special 2NT
-----------
The special 2NT shows

* Limit raise or better without slam interest (11~16 points, 3+ support).
* Somewhat balanced (2+ cards in every suit).

If responder has passed, this 2NT bid has given enough information for opener
to sign off.

### Puppet special 2NT ###
If responder has not passed yet, this 2NT bid is a **puppet** forcing opener
to bid an artificial relay 3♣.  Responder shows support and strength in the
second round.

The 3♥ response is also forcing to game because Bergen 3♦ already takes care of
invitational hands.

<dl>
  <dt>3♦!</dt>
  <dd>Minimum short, invitational+, 11~14 points, 3-card support</dd>

  <dt>3♥!</dt>
  <dd>Minimum long, forcing to game, 12~14 points, 4+-card support</dd>

  <dt>3♠!</dt>
  <dd>Maximum long, forcing to game, 14~16 points, 4+-card support</dd>

  <dt>3NT!</dt>
  <dd>Maximum short, forcing to game, 14~16 points, 3-card support</dd>
</dl>

This convention seems to be invented by Wbridge5.  I guess that this is an
improvement from Jacoby 2NT.  This convention greatly improves 2/1 structure of
Wbridge5.

* Special 2NT handles 3-card limit raise, freeing dustbin 1NT from forcing.
* Jacoby 2NT fits into special 2NT and serious 3NT, leaving no burden for other bids.
* Responder shows.  Opener relays, hiding information from opponents.
