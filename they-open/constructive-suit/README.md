Constructive suits
==================
Constructive suit openings show at least average strength and length in the
bid suit.  One-of-a-suit openings are constructive in a natural bidding system.
Constructive minor openings may move to the 2-level in a strong club or diamond
system.

Surprising auctions
-------------------
**Precise Michaels** provide surprising auctions for those who have played no
French system.  However, these conventions are quite familiar in France.

<dl>
  <dt>(1♣) 2♣!</dt>
  <dd>Natural, 14~19 points, 6+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>(1♣) 2♦!</dt>
  <dd>Michaels cuebid is moved here.</dd>

  <dt>(1m) 3m</dt>
  <dd>The other minor and spades, the 2-suiter uncovered by Michaels and unusual notrump.</dd>

  <dt>(1M) 2M</dt>
  <dd>Michaels but the minor is always clubs.</dd>

  <dt>(1M) 3♣!</dt>
  <dd>The other major and diamonds, the uncovered 2-suiter.</dd>
</dl>

Although unlimited, Michaels cubids are somewhat competitive.  Therefore, their
strength depends on seat and vulnerability, which is described in a [separate
article][michaels] in details.  Nevertheless, 2♦ for majors always requires
mere 8 points because of score and accessibility of a major contract.

Natural 1NT overcall
--------------------
A natural 1NT overcall is almost the same as an 1NT opening.  This bid requires

* 15~18 HCP
* Same distibution as 1NT opening
* Stopper in the adverse suit.

Advancer takes this as an 1NT opening.  This treatment is known as **systems
on**.

Weak jump overcalls
-------------------
A jump in a new suit is always a weak jump overcall by default.  This also
applies to high-level jumps such as (1♣) 4♥.

Weak jump overcalls share the same criteria as preemptive openings.  For
example, (1♣) 2♥ shows the same length and strength as a 2♥ opening.

If partner has passed, one shall preempt as aggressive as 3th-seat opening, for
strength is concentrated in a known opponent.

Gambling 3NT overcall
---------------------
To *gamble* when opponents opened, one must have a **stopper** in the adverse
suit.  This overcall still shows a 7+-card minor lead by AKQ with no stopper in
the **other** side suits.

If opponents opened a minor, one bids 3NT always with the other minor, so
advancer corrects to the assumed minor if they have not enough stoppers to
play 3NT.
