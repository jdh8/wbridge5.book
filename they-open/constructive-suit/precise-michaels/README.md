Precise Michaels
================
Precise Michaels aka **Michaëls précisés** are Michaels cue bids which show
both suits.  These bids are shortcuts to show 5+ cards in 2 suits.  Wbridge5
takes Michaels somewhat constructive, so they are never weaker than simple
overcalls.

Precise Michaels are only active for 1 of a suit.  For a constructive 2 (in an
artificial bidding system), there is no enough bidding space.

Precise Michaels are unlimited and forcing.  They take precedence over takeout
doubles because they are precise in distribution.

Opponents opened 1 of a minor
-----------------------------
The French determine to eliminate weak 2♦, both opening and overcall.

### Majors 2♦ ###
The bid to show majors is always 2♦ regardless of opponents' minor.
