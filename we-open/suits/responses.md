Responses
=========
The openings give little information.  As a result, responder now gives
information about both strength and distribution to help opener make decisions.

Raises
------
A raise shows support in partner's suit.  All raises are non-forcing.  If
responder wants a low-level forcing response, bid a new suit or a convention
instead.

Fast auctions deny extra strength.  Slow ones show.

As a result, delayed raises shows more strength, but they are not discussed
here because the first-round responses are focused here.

### Simple raises ###
A simple raise shows 6~10 DH.  To raise a major requires 3+ cards because
opener has shown 5+; to raise a minor requires 4+.  The requirement on strength
is one point lower in a competitive auction.

  <dd>If partner opened 1♠ or 1♥, <strong>simply raise</strong> to 2♠ or 2♥ respectively.</dd>
</dl>

### Limit raises ###
Such raises show invitational values at 3-level, i.e. 11+ DH but unable to
force to game.  The requirement on strength is one point lower in a competitive
auction.  This is the default meaning of a 3-level jump raise.

A limit raise requires 3+ support for majors, 4+ support for diamonds, or 5+
support for clubs, to ensure that a 8-card fit is found (nearly always).

  <dd>If partner opened 1♦ or 1♣, raise to 3♦ or 3♣ respectively to show a <strong>limit raise</strong>.</dd>
  <dd>One can also show a limit raise in spades with this hand in 1♠ (2♣) 3♠.</dd>
</dl>

### Preemptive raises ###
After a **takeout double**, 3-level raises are preemptive, showing 6~10 DH with
one more card than a simple raise.  As a takeout double shows a strong hand, we
preempt at 3-level with a likely 9-card fit according the **law of total
tricks**.

  <dd>This is a <strong>preemptive raise</strong> for both majors.  Shut opponents up with 1♥ (X) 3♥.</dd>
