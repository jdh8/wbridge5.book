Openings
========
A hand with 13+ DH or 12 H is sufficient for an opening.  If both hands in a
pair are opening hands, they can probably make a game contract.  Therefore,
with an opening hand, one must open to prevent a pass out.

Moreover, some hands with good distribution but poor values are suitable for
an opening as well.  These openings are preemptive, which focus on disturbing
opponents from bidding a good contract.  Criteria for these openings depend
on vulnerability and seat, so there is [a separate article][weak] to describe
them.

[weak]: openings/weak.md

One-of-a-suit openings
----------------------
One must bid 1 of a suit with an opening hand uneligible for a strong opening.
Opening in a major requires 5+ cards, 1♦ for 4+ cards, 1♣ for 3+ cards.  With
the special shape 4-4-3-2, one opens 1♦ as a fallback.  If opener finds more
than one eligible suit, bid the longest suit.  If more than one eligible suit
is equally long, bid the highest suit.

Do not consider suit quality.  In bridge, **quantity** is more important than
quality.

<dl>
   <dt>♠10 ♥1054 ♦KJ52 ♣AKJ97</dt>
   <dd>Open 1♣ because clubs is the longer eligible suit.</dd>

   <dt>♠J9864 ♥A8654 ♦A ♣KJ</dt>
   <dd>Open 1♠ because spades is the higher eligible suit.</dd>

   <dt>♠AQ73 ♥Q1087 ♦A862 ♣K</dt>
   <dd>Open 1♦ because diamonds is the only eligible suit.</dd>

   <dt>♠AK74 ♥AJ54 ♦J107 ♣72</dt>
   <dd>Open 1♦ because no suit is eligible.</dd>
</dl>

Strong notrump openings
-----------------------
The strong notrumps alleviate burden of suit openings.  Balanced and
semibalanced hands with specific strength should be opened in notrump.

<dl>
  <dt>1NT</dt>
  <dd>15–17 H, balanced or pattern 5-4-2-2 or 6-3-2-2 lead by a minor.</dd>

  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>20–21 H, 2–4 cards in each major, 2–5 cards in each minor.</dd>
</dl>

With 12–14 or 18–19 H, one should always open 1 of a suit.  A simple notrump
rebid stands for weak notrump; a jump notrump rebid shows a hand between 1NT
and 2NT openings.

<dl>
   <dt>♠54 ♥A863 ♦AQ986 ♣AJ</dt>
   <dd>Open 1NT.  Although this hand is not balanced, it is acceptable.</dd>

   <dt>♠K9 ♥AKJ84 ♦KJ92 ♣76</dt>
   <dd>Open 1♥.  Always open the major with a major-dominant non-balanced hand.</dd>

   <dt>♠A95 ♥KQ10 ♦AKJ6 ♣K102</dt>
   <dd>Open 2NT.</dd>

   <dt>♠A6 ♥KQ3 ♦K75 ♣AK987</dt>
   <dd>Open 1♣.  This hand is too weak for 2NT but too strong for 1NT.</dd>
</dl>

Strong 2♣ & 2♦ openings
-----------------------
The strong 2♣ shows two kinds of **invitational** hands.  The 2♣ is a limit
bid, so the responder becomes the *captain*.

* 21–23 DH or 4-loser hands unsuitable for a 2NT opening.
* 22–23 H, 2–4 cards in each major, 2–5 cards in each minor.

The strong 2♦ shows a **game-forcing** hand, stronger than 2♣.

### What to bid with a big hand ###
There are three openings describing a hand with 21+ DH or 20+ H, *viz.* 2NT,
2♣, and 2♦.  To better understand this section, it is recommended to revisit
this section after understanding continuations after 2NT, 2♣, and 2♦.

The chance to open 2♦ is slim.  Actually 2♦ is a garbage can for hands way too
strong, clarifying other bids for hands with 21–23 points.  With 24+ DH, 24+ H,
or 3&minus; losers, one must open 2♦.

The frequent rebids of 2♣ openings are 2♥ through 3♦.  The 2NT rebid describes
a notrump hand stronger than 2NT opening.  The majors promise 5+ cards, minors
6+.  Therefore, hands with 5-card major, 6-card minor, or 2NT distribution
are noncontroversial.

The controversial hands are hands with no 5-card major, no 6-card minor, and a
singleton or a void.  These patterns are 4-4-4-1, 5-4-3-1, and 5-4-4-0.

If the signleton in 4-4-4-1 is an ace or a king, take this hand as notrump
distribution.  Bid 1 of the minor suit for the other controversial hands.  A
wrong 1♦ is much easier to play than a wrong 3NT.

<dl>
  <dt>♠AKQ108 ♥J ♦AK1064 ♣K2</dt>
  <dd>Open 2♣ and prepare to rebid 2♠.</dd>

  <dt>♠K2 ♥A8 ♦AK1092 ♣AQ104</dt>
  <dd>Open 2♣ and prepare to rebid 2NT.</dd>

  <dt>♠K ♥AQ76 ♦AK65 ♣KQ104</dt>
  <dd>Open 2NT.  A partially stopped 4-4-4-1 is deemed as a notrump distribution.</dd>

  <dt>♠Q1064 ♥AK6 ♦Q ♣AKQ52</dt>
  <dd>Open 1♣ because this hand is controversial.</dd>

  <dt>♠AKJ6 ♥A93 ♦K ♣AKQJ9</dt>
  <dd>Open 2♦ with such a blockbuster.  There is no controversy for a blockbuster, is there?</dd>
</dl>

Gambling 3NT
------------
Gambling 3NT shows a 7+-card minor lead by AKQ with no stopper in the side
suits.  This is a pass-or-correct bid where responder passes with 2 stopped
suits.

<dl>
  <dt>♠642 ♥K ♦AKQ9652 ♣98</dt>
  <dd>Open 3NT.  Singleton king is no stopper.</dd>

  <dt>♠642 ♥9 ♦AKQ9652 ♣K8</dt>
  <dd>Open 1♦.  Kx is half stopper.</dd>
</dl>
