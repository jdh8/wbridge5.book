Stayman
=======
Stayman is the most used relay in bridge.  This convention helps find 4-4 fit
in a major.  This response requires an exactly 4-card major.

A 5-card major is allowed as an 1NT opener in Wbridge5.  Hence, there are
5-card major rebids after 1NT-2♣.

## Garbage Stayman ##
As the most frequent rebids are simple ♠, ♥, and ♦, responder can bid a Stayman
with a ♠-♥-♦ *3-suiter* with insufficient strength.  Such a legitimized psych
is Garbage Stayman.

Criteria for a *3-suiter* are less strict here.  The 5-4-3-1 pattern also
counts as a *3-suiter*, which ironically provides 56% of hands to this
convention.  However, a 5-card major is unacceptable because a transfer scores
more.

## Responses to opener's notrump rebid ##
Opener's notrump rebid shows both majors.  As a major fit is found, minor bids
are South African transfers to clarify strength.

  <dt>♦/♣!</dt>
  <dd>Transfer to ♠/♥, 4+ cards in the referred major suit.</dd>

  <dt>♠/♥</dt>

</dl>

For Garbage Stayman, the Wbridge5 program generates questionable 1NT-2♣; 2NT-3M
and 2NT-3♣; 3NT-4m! auctions.  Therefore, the responding structure is
**modified in this book**.

### 1NT-2♣; 2NT-? ###
<dl>
  <dt>Game-forcing</dt>
  <dd>Transfer then continue.</dd>

  <dt>Invitational</dt>
  <dd>Bid naturally.</dd>

  <dt>Garbage Stayman</dt>
  <dd>Transfer then pass.</dd>
</dl>

### 2NT-3♣; 3NT-? ###
<dl>
  <dt>Slam try</dt>
  <dd><em>Transfer</em> but control bidding starts, so opener can bid a control instead of completing transfer.</dd>

  <dt>No slam interest</dt>
  <dd>Sign off naturally.</dd>
</dl>

## With 5-4 in majors ##
Since the difference between majors is one card, if opener has chosen one
major, stick with it because it cannot have the shorter fit.

When opener shows indifference, show the longer major.  If opener rebids
diamonds to deny a biddable major, bid the 5-card major on your own.  If opener
rebids notrump to show 4-4, raise your 5-card major.

## Slam try in notrump ##
When no fit is found, we fall back to play in notrump.  Slam try in notrump is
unaffected, as if no Stayman were made.
