Strong notrump openings
=======================
The strong notrump openings 1NT and 2NT move some strong balanced hands out of
suit openings, clarifying the range of opener.  This is crucial in finding 3NT
because HCP is fairly precise to determine notrump tricks.

There are many transfers in the structure of notrump openings because

1. This makes opener declarer, hiding honors from opponents.
2. This saves bidding space.  Responder does not show both shape and strength
   at the same time.

Remind that opener has exposed much information.  Therefore, responder is the
*captain*, who makes decisions.

### Strong jump shifts ###
If responder has not passed, jump shifts are **strong**.  These bids deny a
4-card major side suit.  If there is a 4-card major side suit, bid Stayman 2♣
instead because major slams score more than minor slams.

<dl>
  <dt>3♦, 3♥, 3♠</dt>
  <dd>Strong jump shift, 16+ points, 5+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>4♣</dt>
  <dd>Strong jump shift, 16+ points, 6+ cards.</dd>
</dl>

### Takeout jump shifts ###
If responder has passed, jump shifts are **takeout**, showing a maximum
3-suiter with a signleton or void in the bid suit.

These takeout jump shifts deny a 5-card major.  If there is a 5-card major,
bid Stayman 2♣ for 5-4 majors or transfer for the only major.

Stayman
-------
Stayman is the most used relay in bridge.  This convention helps find 4-4 fit
in a major.  This response requires an exactly 4-card major.

A 5-card major is allowed as an 1NT opener in Wbridge5.  Hence, there are
5-card major rebids after 1NT-2♣.

### Rebids by 1NT opener ###

  <dd>No biddable major.</dd>

  <dt>2♥</dt>

  <dt>3♥</dt>
  <dd>Exactly 4 cards in hearts without biddable spades</dd>

  <dd>Exactly 4 cards in spades without biddable hearts.</dd>

  <dt>3NT</dt>
  <dd>Exactly 4-4 in majors.</dd>
</dl>

### Garbage Stayman ###
As the most frequent rebids are simple ♠, ♥, and ♦, responder can bid a Stayman
with a ♠-♥-♦ *3-suiter* with insufficient strength.  Such a legitimized psych
is Garbage Stayman.

Criteria for a *3-suiter* are less strict here.  The 5-4-3-1 pattern also
counts as a *3-suiter*, which ironically provides 56% of hands to this
convention.  However, a 5-card major is unacceptable because a transfer scores
more.

<dl>
  <dt>♠Q83 ♥10984 ♦J10743 ♣2</dt>
  <dd>Off-shape Garbage Stayman.</dd>

  <dt>♠QJ52 ♥10975 ♦8632 ♣4</dt>
  <dd>In-shape Garbage Stayman.</dd>

  <dt>♠J532 ♥108764 ♦AJ7 ♣7</dt>
  <dd>Bid ♦ to transfer to hearts.</dd>
</dl>

### Responses to opener's notrump rebid ###
Opener's notrump rebid shows both majors.  As a major fit is found, minor bids
are South African transfers to clarify strength.

<dl>
  <dt>♦/♣!</dt>
  <dd>Transfer to ♠/♥, 4+ cards in the referred major suit.</dd>

  <dt>♠/♥</dt>
  <dd>Natural, 4+ cards.</dd>
</dl>

For Garbage Stayman, the Wbridge5 program generates questionable 1NT-2♣; 2NT-3M
and 2NT-3♣; 3NT-4m! auctions.  Therefore, the responding structure is
**modified in this book**.

#### 1NT-2♣; 2NT-? ####
<dl>
  <dt>Game-forcing</dt>
  <dd>Transfer then continue.</dd>

  <dt>Invitational</dt>
  <dd>Bid naturally.</dd>

  <dt>Garbage Stayman</dt>
  <dd>Transfer then pass.</dd>
</dl>

#### 2NT-3♣; 3NT-? ####
<dl>
  <dt>Slam try</dt>
  <dd><em>Transfer</em> but control bidding starts, so opener can bid a control instead of completing transfer.</dd>

  <dt>No slam interest</dt>
  <dd>Sign off naturally.</dd>
</dl>

### With 5-4 in majors ###
Since the difference between majors is one card, if opener has chosen one
major, stick with it because it cannot have the shorter fit.

When opener shows indifference, show the longer major.  If opener rebids
diamonds to deny a biddable major, bid the 5-card major on your own.  If opener
rebids notrump to show 4-4, raise your 5-card major.

### Slam try in notrump ###
When no fit is found, we fall back to play in notrump.  Slam try in notrump is
unaffected, as if no Stayman were made.
