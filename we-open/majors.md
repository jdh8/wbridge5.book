One-of-a-major openings
=======================
Modern bidding systems often require 5+ cards to open in a major.  This is
somewhat *conventional* because usually a 4-card suit is biddable in bridge,
but this greatly improves search of 5-3 and 6-2 major fits.

Although minor openings are lower and more frequent, major openings are
explained first because

1. Major openings are more symmetric where both require 5+ cards.
2. There are fewer mediocre exceptional bids which are difficult for beginners.
3. Some conventions designed for majors can also apply to minors.

### Adjusted responses by a passed responder ###
Responses from a passed responder are no longer forcing because the previous
pass has limited the strength.  Some conventions are cancelled to make these
bids passable.

Preemptive raise to the 4-level
-------------------------------
Such raise directly jumps to game, showing at most 8<sup>&minus;</sup> HCP and
4+ support.  Its minimum strength is determined by vulnerability.

  <dd>10+ DH</dd>

  <dt>Both vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>9+ DH</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
