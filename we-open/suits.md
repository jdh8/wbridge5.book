Basic structure after 1 of a suit
=================================
The main goal of constructive bidding is to find a game.  The secondary goal is
to fall back to a good partial if there is no game.

For **game** contracts, **majors > notrump > minors** in score.  However, for
**partials**, **majors > minors > notrump**.

The common fact is the *majors are yummy*.  Therefore, both players in a pair
pursuit major contracts first.  **Notrump** bids and supports in a **minor**
usually **denies a biddable major**.

In the first rounds of bidding, notrump takes precedence over minors in order
to help finding a 3NT game.  However, bidding a suit after an 1NT is
encouraged.  Signing off at 2 of a suit with 7-card fit is still better than
1NT.

Find a major fit
----------------
The 5-3 and 6-2 fits are discovered by a major opening.  The 4-4, 3-5, 2-6 fits
are found after a minor opening.

### 5-3 fits ###
Responder raises the major with 3-card support, e.g. 1♠-2♠.

### 6-2 fits ###
Opener rebids the major to show 6+ cards, e.g. 1♠-1NT; 2♠.

### 4-4 fits ###
Responder bids the 4-card major.  Opener raises that suit afterwards,
e.g. 1♣-1♥; 2♥.

### 3-5 and 2-6 fits ###
These fits are more tricky to find.  The procedures are somewhat complicated,
so they are described after minor openings.
