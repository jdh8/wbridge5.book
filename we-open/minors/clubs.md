Responses to 1♣
===============
The 1♣ is a dustbin opening.  Opener gives little information, but there are
plenty of choices for responder.

Basic structure
---------------
The 1NT response is always constructive because there is no suit below clubs.
When 1NT acts as a dustbin, responder bids 1NT to show a suit below the
opening.  This is obviously not the case for 1♣.

<dl>
  <dt>1♦, 1♥, 1♠</dt>
  <dd>Forcing, 6+ points, 4+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>1NT</dt>
  <dd>Constructive 1NT, 7<sup>+</sup>~10 HCP, balanced.</dd>

  <dt>2♣</dt>
  <dd>Minimum (6~10 points), 4+ support.</dd>

  <dt>2♦, 2♥, 2♠</dt>
  <dd>Strong jump shift, 17+ points, 4+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>Invite to 3NT, 10~11 HCP, balanced.</dd>

  <dt>3♣</dt>
  <dd>Limit raise, invite to 3NT or 5♣, 11~16 points, 5+ support.</dd>

  <dt>3♦, 3♥, 3♠</dt>
  <dd>Splinter, 12~17 points, <strong>0~1 card</strong>, 5+ support.</dd>

  <dt>3NT</dt>
  <dd>To play, 12~15 HCP, balanced.</dd>
</dl>

### Choice of new suit ###
1. Choose the longest suit.
2. To break a tie, bid the cheapest **call** for 4-4, the highest **suit** for
   5-5 or above.
3. Nevertheless, if responder cannot force to game, skip diamonds in 4-4.

<dl>
  <dt>♠KQ65 ♥653 ♦KJ86 ♣J9</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♠.  Skip diamonds because you cannot force to game.</dd>

  <dt>♠10983 ♥9 ♦KQJ103 ♣J72</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♦.  Diamonds are longer than spades.</dd>

  <dt>♠KQ93 ♥72 ♦AK73 ♣J63</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♦ because you can force to game.</dd>

  <dt>♠KQ105 ♥7643 ♦J642 ♣10</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♥.  Skip diamonds, and then 1♥ is the cheaper call.</dd>

  <dt>♠Q974 ♥A1062 ♦AQ108 ♣7</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♦.  No skipping for a game-forcing hand.</dd>
</dl>

### Simple raise ###
The 2♣ simple raise is not so simple.

For preemption, responder raises to 2♣ with 4+ clubs and no 4-card major in a
non-constructive hand.  This is the only case that 2♣ responder should has only
4 clubs.

For a constructive hand, responder always raises with 5+ clubs and an
unbalanced distribution because constructive 1NT is preferred.

<dl>
  <dt>♠976 ♥965 ♦A109 ♣J1085</dt>
  <dd>Bid 2♣.  This hand is too weak for constructive 1NT.</dd>

  <dt>♠QJ6 ♥J5 ♦J932 ♣J987</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1♦.  This hand is too weak for constructive 1NT.</dd>

  <dt>♠964 ♥104 ♦AJ65 ♣A1094</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1NT.  The constructive 1NT is preferred over a minor suit.</dd>

  <dt>♠53 ♥K84 ♦432 ♣KQ765</dt>
  <dd>Bid 1NT.  The constructive 1NT is preferred over a minor suit.</dd>

  <dt>♠8 ♥J43 ♦Q762 ♣A6432</dt>
  <dd>Bid 2♣.  Make a constructive raise with unbalanced distribution.</dd>
</dl>

Responses by a passed hand
--------------------------
Since responder has made a limit pass, which denies stength of opening,
new-suit responses are no longer forcing.

Jump shifts from 2♥ on are fit-showing because responder gave up preemptive
opening.

<dl>
  <dt>1♦, 1♥, 1♠</dt>
  <dd>Non-forcing, 6+ points, 4+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>2♦</dt>
  <dd>Weak jump shift, 8+ points, 6+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>2♥, 2♠, 3♦</dt>
  <dd>Fit-showing, 11+ points, 5+ cards, 5+ support.</dd>
</dl>

Responses after a takeout double
--------------------------------
The takeout double shows opening values, so responder should bid more
preemptively.  There are some adjustments to the basic structure.

Playing 2NT or 3NT is infeasible now as 1♣xx is more profitable.  As a result,
the meaning of 2NT is changed to a convention and 3NT is never used now.  For
their original meanings, redouble instead.

Jump shifts become **weak** if responder unpassed.  Redouble to show strength
for original strong jump shifts.  Keep in mind that **fit-showing** by a passed
responder are unadjusted because *the previous **pass denies both** jump
shifts*.

<dl>
  <dt>XX</dt>
  <dd>Invitational+ hands (11+ points) which do not qualify as a Truscott 2NT.</dd>

  <dt>2♣</dt>
  <dd>A simple raise can now be made with only 5 points.</dd>

  <dt>2♦, 2♥, 2♠</dt>
  <dd><strong>Weak jump shift</strong> if unpassed, showing 8+ points and 6+ cards.</dd>

  <dt>2♥, 2♠, 3♦</dt>
  <dd><strong>Fit-showing</strong> if passed.  These bids are unchanged.</dd>

  <dt>2NT</dt>
  <dd>Truscott 2NT, which shows a limit raise i.e. former 3♣.</dd>

  <dt>3♣</dt>
  <dd>Preemptive raise, 7~10 points, 5+ support.</dd>
</dl>

Responses after a simple suit overcall
--------------------------------------
Wbridge5 employs French convention for such low-level competitive auctions.
These two auctions are highlighted for the surprised.

<dl>
  <dt>1♣ (1♦) X</dt>
  <dd>Collante, negative double, 6+ points with exactly 4 hearts.  No information given about spades.</dd>

  <dt>1♣ (1♠) 2♣!</dt>
  <dd>Rodrigue, negative free bid in <strong>hearts</strong>, 7~10 points with 5+ cards in hearts.  No information given about clubs.</dd>
</dl>

The French insist on showing length of hearts quickly to compete with
opponents' latent spades.

### Collante ###
The French word *collante* means “sticky” in English.  This means that a
negative double after a 1♦ or 1♥ overcall shows exactly 4 cards in **the next
suit** *viz* ♥ or ♠ respectively.  As a consequence, the direct bid of the suit
now shows 5+ cards.

Be aware that Collante only affects one suit.  The meaning of 1♠ in 1♣ (1♦) 1♠
is the same as 1♣-1♠, which shows 4+ cards in spades, because only hearts is
affected for (1♦).

<dl>
  <dt>1♣ (1♦) X</dt>
  <dd>Negative double, 6+ points with exactly 4 hearts.</dd>

  <dt>1♣ (1♦) 1♥</dt>
  <dd>Free bid, 6+ points with 5+ hearts.</dd>

  <dt>1♣ (1♦) 1♠</dt>
  <dd>Free bid, 6+ points with 4+ spades.</dd>

  <dt>1♣ (1♥) X</dt>
  <dd>Negative double, 6+ points with exactly 4 spades.</dd>

  <dt>1♣ (1♥) 1♠</dt>
  <dd>Free bid, 6+ points with 5+ spades.</dd>
</dl>

### Rodrigue ###
This convention is uncommon in France, but is used by Wbridge5.  After a 1♠
overcall, we give up the simple raise for a negative free bid of hearts.  This
bid differentiates with the negative double by showing 5+ cards of hearts,
making the negative double show exactly 4 cards.

Wbridge5 madly insists on showing length of hearts quickly to compete with
opponents' spades.

<dl>
  <dt>1♣ (1♠) X</dt>
  <dd>Negative double, 6+ points with exactly 4 hearts.</dd>

  <dt>1♣ (1♠) 2♣!</dt>
  <dd>Negative free bid of <strong>hearts</strong>, 6~10 points with 5+ hearts.</dd>

  <dt>1♣ (1♠) 2♥</dt>
  <dd>(Positive) free bid, 11+ points with 5+ hearts.</dd>

  <dt>1♣ (1♠) 3♣</dt>
  <dd>Mixed raise, 9+ points with 5+ support.</dd>
</dl>
