Preemptive openings
===================
Preemptive bids are bids higher than usual to aggresively reach a contract,
avoiding defending.  Below the game level, a preemptive opening shows
< 12 H but some offensive values.  A game-level preemptive can be made with
opening defensive values beacause a game is reached anyway.

Preemptive openings are available to the first three seats only, where there
is still an opponent to block.  The 3rd seat can make the most aggresive
openings because the partner has passed.

Weak 2
------
The weak 2 requires 6+ cards for the first two seats, or 5+ cards for
the 3rd seat.  If non-vulnerable, the first two seats can also open a weak 2
with AKxxx or AQJxx.  The strength requirements are as follows.

<dl>
  <dt>Vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>9–13 DH</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>7–13 DH</dd>

  <dt>Non-vulnerable vs vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>6–13 DH or any 7+ cards</dd>
</dl>

3 of a suit
-----------
Opening 3 of a suit promises 6+ cards with further requirements.

### First 2 seats ###
If there are only 6 card in the suit, it shall be no weaker than KJ10xxx if
minor or KQJxxx if major.  The required strength is 2 more points than weak 2.

<dl>
  <dt>Vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>11–15 DH and 8–11 H</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>9–14 DH</dd>

  <dt>Non-vulnerable vs vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>8–14 DH</dd>
</dl>

### The 3rd seat ###
Quality of a 6-card minor can be as weak as KJxxxx in the 3rd seat, but no
weaker for a major because one sould bid the weak 2 for a rubbish major.  No
more requirements on defensive values because we will never have enough values
for a 3NT.

<dl>
  <dt>Vulnerable vs non-vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>9–15 DH</dd>

  <dt>Both vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>8–15 DH</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>7–14 DH</dd>

  <dt>Non-vulnerable vs vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>6–14 DH.  6-card rubbish minor is acceptable here.</dd>
</dl>
