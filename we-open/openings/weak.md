Preemptive openings
===================
Preemptive bids are bids higher than usual to aggresively reach a contract,
avoiding defending.  Below the game level, a preemptive opening shows
**insufficient** defensive values to open but some offensive values.
A game-level preemptive can be made with opening defensive values beacause a
game is reached anyway.

Preemptive openings are available to the first three seats only, where there
is still an opponent to block.  The 3rd seat can make the most aggresive
openings because the partner has passed.

Weak 2
------
The weak 2 requires 6+ cards or AKxxx for the first two seats, or 5+ cards for
the 3rd seat.  The strength requirement is as follows.

<dl>
  <dt>Vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>9–13 DH</dd>

  <dt>None vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>7–13 DH</dd>

  <dt>Non-vulnerable vs vulnerable</dt>
  <dd>6–13 DH or any 7+ cards</dd>
</dl>
