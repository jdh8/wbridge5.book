Strong notrump openings
=======================
The strong notrump openings 1NT and 2NT move some strong balanced hands out of
suit openings, clarifying the range of opener.  This is crucial in finding 3NT
because HCP is fairly precise to determine notrump tricks.

There are many transfers in the structure of notrump openings because

1. This makes opener declarer, hiding honors from opponents.
2. This saves bidding space.  Responder does not show both shape and strength
   at the same time.
