One-of-a-minor openings
=======================
The minor openings are the most frequent openings.  Particularly, 1♣ is the
most frequent, 1♦ the second.  Therefore, it is important to learn the
continuation of these openings.

The minor openings can be made from three kinds of hands:

* Open the longer minor in a balanced hand with 12~14 or 18~19 H without a
  5-card major.
* Open the longest suit in an unbalanced hand with normal openings strength.
* Open the longest suit in a 3-suiter or 5-4-3-1 with 2♣ strength where the
  5-card suit is a minor.  See also [the dedicated section][big].

Opener probably has a 4-card major.  Therefore, responder should always think
about bidding the major first.  The only situation where responder skips a
major suit is to make a **reverse**.
