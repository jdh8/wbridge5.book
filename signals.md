Defensive signals
=================
Defensive signals are deliberate playing of cards when being a defender.

Defensive carding
-----------------
The **high-low** carding is deliberate, while the low-high is usual.
Therefore, the high-low signal always tells the truth becuase a low-high may be
a tentative carding.

In the first 7 tricks, Wbridge5 always plays the **count signal**.  A high-low
carding shows an **even** number of cards in that suit.  There is no signals
since the 8th trick.  To make an unambiguous signal, when making a high-low
signal, Wbridge5 chooses the highest card below 8 as the high card.  If a honor 
was played, this honor card does not count in the number of cards.

Lead the highest card in consecutive cards but follow the lowest.  The only
exception is AK doubleton, where the king should be played first.  This is to
differentiate A**K** from **A**Kx.

### Vinje signals ###
The Vinje signals shows pattern with trump cardings.  A high-low carding shows
an **even pattern**, which is dealt with 3 even-numbered suits.

Opening lead
-------------
The opening lead against a suit contract is identical to the defensive carding.

The opening lead against a notrump is more complicated.  If leading to a
partner's suit, it is also the same as the defensive carding.  However,
different rules apply when leading from one's own suit.

* Leading an honor shows 3+ honors in that suit, and the card played is the
  highest in a series of consecutive honors.
  -	The 9 is deemed as a consecutive honor of 10.  As a result, leading a 10
	implies a higher honor and the 9.
  - There is no more leading from AK doubleton, so the king-then-ace carding
	shall denote something else.  The king is lead from A**K**Q or A**K**J10 to
	signal the thrid defensive trick.
* A spot card is the 4th highest card of the suit.
  - The 2 shows exactly 4 cards.
  - If preferred suit has no more than 3 cards, lead the highest spot card,
	e.g. Q**4**3 or **9**65.
