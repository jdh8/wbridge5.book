Defensive signals
=================
Defensive signals are deliberate playing of cards when being a defender.

Defensive carding
-----------------
The **high-low** carding is deliberate, while the low-high is usual.
Therefore, the high-low signal always tells the truth becuase a low-high may be
a tentative carding.

In the first 7 tricks, Wbridge5 always plays the **count signal**.  A high-low
carding shows an **even** number of cards in that suit.  There is no signals
since the 8th trick.  To make an unambiguous signal, when making a high-low
signal, Wbridge5 chooses the highest card below 8 as the high card.  If a honor 
(10 or higher) was played, this honor card does not count in the number of
cards.

Lead the highest card in consecutive honors but follow the lowest.  The only
exception is AK doubleton, where the king should be played first.  This is to
differentiate AK from AKx.  When your partner sees ace then king, they expects
that you still have a card in that suit.

### Vinje signals ###
The Vinje signals shows pattern with trump cardings.  A high-low carding shows
an **even pattern**, which is dealt with 3 even-numbered suits.

Opening leads
-------------
Opening leads against a suit contract is identical to the defensive carding.

Opneing leads against a notrump is more complicated.

* Leading an honor (10 or higher) shows 3+ honors in that suit, and the card
  played is the highest in a series of consecutive honors.
  -	The 9 is deemed as a consecutive honor of 10.  As a result, leading a 10
	implies a higher honor and the 9.
  - There is no more leading from AK doubleton, so the king-then-ace carding
	shall denote something else.  The king is lead from AKQ or AKJ10 to signal
	the thrid defensive trick.
* A spot card is the 4th highest card of the suit.
